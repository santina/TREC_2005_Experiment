     methyltransferase gene and tolerance to thiopurines in acute leukemia]
PG  - 929-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: For the purpose of clarifying the influence of thiopurine
     methyltransferase (TPMT) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on
     the efficacy of thiopurines and risk for its toxicity and therefore
     improving the safety and efficacy of thiopurines, the authors investigated
     TPMT genotype in acute leukemia in children who were intolerant to the
     treatment with 6-mercap topurine (6-MP). METHODS: TPMT genotype was
     determined in an unrelated population of 250 Chinese healthy blood donors
     and 280 children with acute leukemia. TPMT genotyping assay was based on
     polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction digestion of PCR products,
     denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and direct DNA
     sequencing in the TPMT * 2 (G238C), TPMT * 3A (G460A, A719G) and TPMT * 3C
     (A719G). RESULTS: There were 10 TPMT * 1/TPMT * 3C heterozygotes in 280
     children. The frequency of the polymorphism was 3.6%. All the involved
     alleles were TPMT * 3C. Of the 160 children acute leukemia evaluated, 45
     (26%) were intolerant to 6-MP. Presentations included hepatotoxicity and
     hematological toxicity. Six out of 45 children were heterozygous, while
     the other 39 were wild type homozygous. Before dosage adjustments for
     thiopurine, the hematologic toxicity and hepatotoxicity in TPMT
     heterozygous individuals occurred more frequently than in homozygous.
     Therefore, cases of TPMT heterozygotes experienced more missed doses of
     6-MP. CONCLUSIONS: TPMT genotype is associated with tolerance in acute
     leukemia in children. The heterozygote individuals have low TPMT activity.
     Therefore the frequencies of hemtopoietic toxicity and hepatoxicity are
     high after using 6-MP. Detection of SNPs in the TPMT genes is useful in
     identifying children before administration of 6-MP.

PG  - 277-85
AB  - Pharmacogenetics fields of research was initially restricted to drug
     metabolism enzymes. It has recently progressed to drug transporters,
     receptors, and any kind of targets that can modulate drug response. This
     rapid extension of pharmacogenetics to all the different medical
     specialties is in close relation with the recent completion of the draft
     sequence of the human genome and the discovery that about 0.1% of its
     sequence is polymorphic. The goal of pharmacogenetics for the next years
     is clearly to determine the clinical consequences of these 2-3 million
     single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Things can be schematically
     divided in two situations. (1) Frequent SNPs (allele frequency > 10%)
     which have a low impact on drug response (odds ratios < 2), even combined
     with other SNPs in haplotype combinations. Such situations, which are by
     far the most frequent, have no clinical relevance for a single patient to
     predict its response to a particular drug. CYP3A and MDR1 allelic variants
     are good examples of such frequent situations. (2) Rare SNPs, which
     dramatically alter the expression or the activity of a target protein, can
     sometimes have a real clinical relevance (odds ratios > 5), usually to
     predict drug side effects. Only few examples, such as TPMT and CYP2C9
     genetic polymorphisms, can illustrate this rare situation. Unfortunately,
     less than 1% of the population is concerned by these rare SNPs, and
     genotyping can only explain a small part of the variability of the
     response to a single drug. Beside the impressive mass of data available
     for pharmacogenetics, it is surprising to observe its poor development in
     routine medical practice. This discrepancy relies mainly on educational
     and methodological problems, which might be solved in the decade. To
     promote pharmacogenetics in routine medical practice, large prospective
     randomized trials are needed to demonstrate that pharmacogenetic
     orientated prescription can sometimes predict drug response without
     dramatic increase in costs.

TI  - Pyrosequencing of TPMT alleles in a general Swedish population and in
     patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 288-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interindividual differences in therapeutic efficacy in
     patients treated with thiopurines might be explained by the presence of
     thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) alleles that encode for reduced TPMT
     enzymatic activity. It is therefore of value to know an individual's
     inherent capacity to express TPMT. Method: We developed a pyrosequencing
     method to detect 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TPMT. A
     Swedish population (n = 800) was examined for TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B, TPMT*3C,
     and TPMT*2. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (n = 24) and healthy
     volunteers (n = 6), selected on the basis of TPMT enzymatic activity, were
     investigated for all 10 SNPs to determine the relationship between TPMT
     genotype and phenotype. RESULTS: In the general population we identified
     the following genotypes with nonfunctional alleles: TPMT*1/*3A (*3A
     allelic frequency, 3.75%), TPMT*1/*3C (*3C allelic frequency, 0.44%),
     TPMT*1/*3B (*3B allelic frequency, 0.13%), and TPMT*1/*2 (*2 allelic
     frequency, 0.06%). All nine individuals with normal enzymatic activity
     were wild-type TPMT*1/*1. Thirteen individuals with intermediate activity
     were either TPMT*1/*3A (n = 12) or TPMT*1/*2 (n = 1). Eight individuals
     with low enzymatic activity were TPMT*3A/*3A (n = 4), TPMT*3A/*3C (n = 2),
     or TPMT*1/*3A (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Next to wild type, the most frequent
     alleles in Sweden are TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C. A previously established
     phenotypic cutoff for distinguishing normal from intermediate metabolizers
     was confirmed. To identify the majority of cases (90%) with low or
     intermediate TPMT activity, it was sufficient to analyze individuals for
     only 3 of the 10 SNPs investigated. Nevertheless, this investigation
     indicates that other mutations might be of relevance for decreased
     enzymatic activity.

TI  - Azathioprine as a treatment for severe atopic eczema in children with a
     partial thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT) deficiency.
PG  - 531-4
AB  - Azathioprine is a valuable agent in the treatment of severe childhood
     atopic eczema. Thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT) exhibits autosomal
     codominant polymorphism and plays an important role in the metabolism of
     azathioprine. In most large population groups studied to date,
     approximately 10% of the population had intermediate activity due to
     heterozygosity at the TPMT locus, and about 0.33% were TPMT deficient.
     TPMT deficiency results in the accumulation of thioguanine nucleotides and
     cytotoxic 6-mercaptopurine metabolites. Previously it was considered
     unsafe to treat this group with azathioprine because of what was
     considered to be an unacceptably high risk of toxicity (profound
     myelosuppression). Better understanding of the pharmacogenetics of purine
     metabolism has changed this, and with appropriate dose adjustments,
     individuals who have a partial TPMT deficiency (heterozygotes) can now be
     treated with thiopurines. It seems probable that these individuals are
     more likely to have a therapeutic response while being at lower risk of
     developing dose-related hepatotoxicity because of the reduced doses
     required to effect a therapeutic response. Two patients with severe
     refractory atopic eczema, both of whom had a partial TPMT deficiency, have
     had an excellent response to treatment with azathioprine. They were
     treated with half-standard doses and response to treatment occurred within
     2 weeks.

     revealed by complete genome analysis.
PG  - 1242-56
AB  - The genome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 encodes an unexpected capacity to
     tolerate heavy metals and metalloids. The availability of the complete
     chromosomal sequence allowed the categorization of 61 open reading frames
     likely to be involved in metal tolerance or homeostasis, plus seven more
     possibly involved in metal resistance mechanisms. Some systems appeared to
     be duplicated. These might perform redundant functions or be involved in
     tolerance to different metals. In total, P. putida was found to bear two
     systems for arsenic (arsRBCH), one for chromate (chrA), four to six
     systems for divalent cations (two cadA and two to four czc chemiosmotic
     antiporters), two systems for monovalent cations: pacS, cusCBA (plus one
     cryptic silP gene containing a frameshift mutation), two operons for Cu
     chelation (copAB), one metallothionein for metal(loid) binding, one system
     for Te/Se methylation (tpmT) and four ABC transporters for the uptake of
     essential Zn, Mn, Mo and Ni (one nikABCDE, two znuACB and one mobABC).
     Some of the metal-related clusters are located in gene islands with
     atypical genome signatures. The predicted capacity of P. putida to endure
     exposure to heavy metals is discussed from an evolutionary perspective.

AB  - The outcome for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has
     improved dramatically with current therapy resulting in an event free
     survival exceeding 75% for most patients. However significant challenges
     remain including developing better methods to predict which patients can
     be cured with less toxic treatment and which ones will benefit from
     augmented therapy. In addition, 25% of patients fail therapy and novel
     treatments that are focused on undermining specifically the leukemic
     process are needed urgently. In Section I, Dr. Carroll reviews current
     approaches to risk classification and proposes a system that incorporates
     well-established clinical parameters, genetic lesions of the blast as well
     as early response parameters. He then provides an overview of emerging
     technologies in genomics and proteomics and how they might lead to more
     rational, biologically based classification systems. In Section II, Drs.
     Mary Relling and Stella Davies describe emerging findings that relate to
     host features that influence outcome, the role of inherited germline
     variation. They highlight technical breakthroughs in assessing germline
     differences among patients. Polymorphisms of drug metabolizing genes have
     been shown to influence toxicity and the best example is the gene
     thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) a key enzyme in the metabolism of
     6-mercaptopurine. Polymorphisms are associated with decreased activity
     that is also associated with increased toxicity. The role of polymorphisms
     in other genes whose products play an important role in drug metabolism as
     well as cytokine genes are discussed. In Sections III and IV, Drs. James
     Downing and Cheryl Willman review their findings using gene expression
     profiling to classify ALL. Both authors outline challenges in applying
     this methodology to analysis of clinical samples. Dr. Willman describes
     her laboratory's examination of infant leukemia and precursor B-ALL where
     unsupervised approaches have led to the identification of inherent
     biologic groups not predicted by conventional morphologic,
     immunophenotypic and cytogenetic variables. Dr. Downing describes his
     results from a pediatric ALL expression database using over 327 diagnostic
     samples, with 80% of the dataset consisting of samples from patients
     treated on a single institutional protocol. Seven distinct leukemia
     subtypes were identified representing known leukemia subtypes including:
     BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, rearrangements in the MLL gene, hyperdiploid
     karyotype (i.e., > 50 chromosomes), and T-ALL as well as a new leukemia
     subtype. A subset of genes have been identified whose expression appears
     to be predictive of outcome but independent verification is needed before
     this type of analysis can be integrated into treatment assignment.
     Chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells by activating apoptosis, or
     programmed cell death. In Section V, Dr. John Reed describes major
     apoptotic pathways and the specific role of key proteins in this response.
     The expression level of some of these proteins, such as BCL2, BAX, and
     caspase 3, has been shown to be predictive of ultimate outcome in
     hematopoietic tumors. New therapeutic approaches that modulate the
     apoptotic pathway are now available and Dr. Reed highlights those that may
     be applicable to the treatment of childhood ALL.

PG  - 617-26
AB  - A common genetic polymorphism for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is
     a major factor responsible for individual variation in the toxicity and
     therapeutic efficacy of thiopurine drugs in humans. We set out to
     determine whether inheritance might also influence the level of TPMT
     activity in the domestic cat, Felis domesticus. As a first step, red blood
     cell (RBC) TPMT activity was measured in blood samples from 104 cats. The
     average level of cat RBC TPMT activity was lower than that observed in
     humans and was not related to either age or sex of the animal. We then
     cloned and characterized the F. domesticus TPMT cDNA and gene.
     Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis was performed by resequencing the
     cat TPMT gene using DNA samples from 12 animals with high and 12 with low
     levels of RBC TPMT activity. Thirty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms
     (SNPs) were observed in these 24 DNA samples, including five that altered
     the encoded amino acid, resulting in nine allozymes (six observed and
     three inferred). Twelve of the 31 feline TPMT SNPs were associated,
     collectively, with 56% of the variation in level of RBC TPMT activity in
     these 24 animals. When those 12 SNPs were assayed in all 89 cats for which
     DNA was available, 30% of the variation in level of RBC TPMT activity was
     associated with these 12 polymorphisms. After expression in COS-1 cells,
     five of the eight variant cat allozymes displayed decreased levels of both
     TPMT activity and immunoreactive protein compared with the wild-type
     allozyme. These observations are compatible with the conclusion that
     inheritance is an important factor responsible for variation in levels of
     RBC TPMT activity in the cat. They also represent a step toward the
     application of pharmacogenetic principles to companion animal thiopurine
     drug therapy.

     the most developed examples of pharmacogenetics, spanning from molecular
     genetics to clinical diagnostics for individualizing thiopurine therapy
     (i.e. azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and thioguanine). Elucidation of the
     molecular mechanisms and biochemical consequences of TPMT deficiency
     demonstrates how pharmacogenetic traits can be identified, characterized,
     and translated to the bedside. Insights gained from studies of the TPMT

     cancer therapy by avoiding toxic side effects in genetically distinct
     subgroups of patients.

     receiving azathioprine.
PG  - 13-8
AB  - Azathioprine (AZA) is widely used in the management of rheumatological
     diseases. Despite its efficacy, AZA can often cause bone marrow
     suppression, notably leucopenia, which has been recorded in up to 17% of
     patients taking AZA for rheumatoid arthritis, though this can be
     considered clinically significant in about 3% overall. Severe
     myelosuppression, associated with abnormal AZA metabolism, is linked to
     the thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genetic polymorphism. TPMT status
     can be assessed prior to AZA treatment by measuring enzyme activity or
     genotyping techniques. Analysis of recent data suggests that by optimizing
     the AZA dose on the basis of TPMT status testing (with a substantial
     reduction in dose for patients homozygous for mutant TPMT alleles), a
     reduction in drug-induced morbidity and cost savings can be made by
     avoiding hospitalization and rescue therapy for leucopenic events. In this
     article we review the pharmacogenetic and clinical implications of the
     TPMT polymorphism, emphasizing its relevance to rheumatologists managing
     diseases with AZA.

TI  - Tertiary structure of thiopurine methyltransferase from Pseudomonas
     syringae, a bacterial orthologue of a polymorphic, drug-metabolizing
     enzyme.
PG  - 573-85
AB  - In humans, the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) metabolizes
     6-thiopurine (6-TP) medications, including 6-thioguanine, 6-mercaptopurine
     and azathioprine, commonly used for immune suppression and for the
     treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. S-Methylation by TPMT prevents
     the intracellular conversion of these drugs into active 6-thioguanine
     nucleotides (6-TGNs). Genetic polymorphisms in the TPMT protein sequence
     have been associated with decreased tissue enzymatic activities and an
     increased risk of life-threatening myelo-suppression from standard doses
     of 6-TP medications. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that TPMT
     deficiency is primarily associated with increased degradation of the
     polymorphic proteins through an ubiquitylation and proteasomal-dependent
     pathway. We have now determined the tertiary structure of the bacterial
     orthologue of TPMT from Pseudomonas syringae using NMR spectroscopy.
     Bacterial TPMT similarly catalyzes the S-adenosylmethionine
     (SAM)-dependent transmethylation of 6-TPs and shares 45% similarity (33%
     identity) with the human enzyme. Initial studies revealed an unstructured
     N terminus, which was removed for structural studies and subsequently
     determined to be required for enzymatic activity. Despite lacking sequence
     similarity to any protein of known three-dimensional structure, the
     tertiary structure of bacterial TPMT reveals a classical SAM-dependent
     methyltransferase topology, consisting of a seven-stranded beta-sheet
     flanked by alpha-helices on both sides. However, some deviations from the
     consensus topology, along with multiple insertions of structural elements,
     are evident. A review of the many experimentally determined tertiary
     structures of SAM-dependent methyltransferases demonstrates that such
     structural deviations from the consensus topology are common and often
     functionally important.

AB  - Genetic polymorphism of TPMT activity is an important factor responsible
     for large individual differences in thiopurine toxicity and therapeutic
     efficacy. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of TPMT
     activity as well as the types and frequencies of mutant alleles in a
     Bulgarian population sample. TPMT activity was measured in 313 Bulgarians,
     using an established HPLC procedure. All individuals with TPMT activity
     less than 12.0 nmol/(mL Ery.h) (n = 76) were additionally genotyped using
     a color multiplex hybridization assay. The samples were tested for TPMT*2,
     *3A, *3B, *3C, *3D, *4, and *6 mutant alleles. TPMT activities varied from
     1.1 to 24.0 nmol/(mL Ery.h) [mean 14.2 +/- 3.2 nmol/(mL Ery.h)]: 92.3% of
     the individuals investigated had high TPMT activity [>10 nmol/(mL Ery.
     h)], whereas 7.4% were intermediate [2.8-10 nmol/(mL Ery.h)], and 0.3%
     were low metabolizers [< 2.8 nmol/(mL Ery.h)]. A significant
     gender-related difference in TPMT activity (P = 0.02) was observed with
     6.2% higher values in men than in women. There was no significant
     correlation between age and enzyme activity (r = 0.06, P = 0.27). Genotype
     analysis revealed three mutant TPMT alleles: 2, 3A, and 3C. The frequency
     of these alleles among the TPMT-deficient individuals was 2.17%, 30.4%,
     and 2.17%, respectively. These data show a similar distribution of TPMT
     activity among the Bulgarian population investigated as in most other
     white populations with the frequency of intermediate metabolizers being
     somewhat lower (7.4% versus approximately 11%) in the Bulgarians. The most
     common variant allele was TPMT-3A, as in other white populations.

PG  - 150-7
AB  - The elimination of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine is greatly influenced
     by polymorphisms in the enzymes responsible for their metabolism. Patients
     who are deficient in thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) are at an
     increased risk for azathioprine- and 6-mercaptopurine-induced toxicities
     because of the accumulation of toxic metabolites, and patients with high
     TPMT activity may not receive maximum benefit because of the increased
     clearance. Therefore, routine TPMT genotyping prior to the initiation of
     azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy should be considered to decrease
     the risk of severe and possibly preventable adverse effects and to
     identify patients who might benefit from higher doses. However, measuring
     the TPMT activity at baseline is not a substitute for monitoring white
     blood cell counts throughout therapy because drug therapy and/or other
     conditions may still cause myelosuppression in these patients.

     association and allozyme degradation.
PG  - 555-64
AB  - Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyses the S-methylation of
     thiopurine drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine. A common genetic polymorphism
     for TPMT is associated with large individual variations in thiopurine drug
     toxicity and therapeutic efficacy. TPMT*3A, the most common variant allele
     in Caucasians, has two alterations in amino acid sequence, resulting in
     striking decreases in TPMT protein levels. This phenomenon results, in
     part, from rapid degradation through a ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated
     process. We set out to test the hypothesis that chaperone proteins might
     be involved in targeting TPMT for degradation. As a first step, hsp90,
     hsp70 and the cochaperone hop were immunoprecipitated from a rabbit
     reticulocyte lysate (RRL) that included radioactively labelled *3A and
     wild-type TPMT. TPMT*3A was much more highly associated with all three
     chaperones than was the wild-type enzyme. The RRL was also used to confirm
     the accelerated degradation of *3A compared to wild-type TPMT. Treatment
     of RRL with the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin resulted in enhanced
     association of hsp90 with wild-type TPMT, an observation that correlated
     with accelerated ubiquitin-dependent degradation of wild-type TPMT.
     Geldanamycin treatment of COS-1 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged
     wild-type also resulted in a time and geldanamycin concentration-dependent
     decrease in TPMT activity and protein, which was compatible with results
     obtained in the RRL. These observations indicate that TPMT is a client
     protein for hsp90 and suggest that chaperone proteins, especially hsp90,
     are involved in targeting both TPMT*3A and, in the presence of
     geldanamycin, the wild-type allozyme for degradation. Therefore, chaperone
     proteins play an important mechanistic role in this clinically significant
     example of pharmacogenetic variation in drug metabolism.

TI  - Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) genotype does not predict adverse
     drug reactions to thiopurine drugs in patients with inflammatory bowel
     disease.
PG  - 395-400
AB  - BACKGROUND: Azathioprine and mercaptopurine (MP) are well established
     treatments for inflammatory bowel disease but they have severe adverse
     effects that prevent their use in some patients. The likelihood and type
     of adverse effect may relate to thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme
     activity and genotype. AIM: To compare the TPMT genotype frequencies in
     patients with inflammatory bowel disease who have had severe adverse
     effects to those who tolerate azathioprine or MP (controls). METHODS:
     Patients with inflammatory bowel disease who had been treated with
     azathioprine or MP in Christchurch between 1996 and 2002 were identified.
     Patients with adverse effects, and controls, were invited to provide a
     peripheral blood sample for analysis of TPMT genotype. The genotype
     frequencies were then compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Fifty-six
     patients were identified with adverse effects requiring cessation of
     therapy, of which 50 were genotyped. Reactions included allergic-type
     (25%), hepatitis (33%), nausea/vomiting (14%), bone marrow suppression
     (10%), pancreatitis (6%) and other (12%). Five of 50 patients with
     reactions had TPMT genotype *1/*3, one had *3/*3, and the rest had the
     wildtype genotype *1/*1. The patient with genotype *3/*3 had severe
     pancytopenia requiring hospitalization. Three of 50 controls had the *1/*3
     genotype and the rest were *1/*1. CONCLUSIONS: The TPMT allele frequency
     in our population with inflammatory bowel disease is similar to that
     reported elsewhere. There was a slight trend for more frequent TPMT
     mutations in the patients with adverse reactions, but this was not
     statistically significant. Most patients with reactions did not have gene
     mutations.

TI  - Prospects and limits of pharmacogenetics: the thiopurine methyl
     transferase (TPMT) experience.
PG  - 149-55
AB  - Thiopurine drug metabolism is a quintessential case of pharmacogenetics. A
     wealth of experimental and clinical data on polymorphisms in the
     thiopurine metabolizing enzyme thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT) has
     been generated in the past decade. Pharmacogenetic testing prior to
     thiopurine treatment is already being practiced to some extent in the
     clinical context, and it is likely that it will be among the first
     pharmacogenetic tests applied on a regular basis. We analyzed the
     published TPMT data and identified some lessons to be learned for the
     future implementation of pharmacogenetics for thiopurines as well as in
     other fields. These include the need for comprehensive and unbiased data
     on allele frequencies relevant to a broad range of populations worldwide.
     The nature and frequency of TPMT gene polymorphisms in some ethnic groups
     is still a matter of speculation, as the vast majority of studies on TPMT
     allele distribution are limited to only a small subset of alleles and
     populations. Secondly, an appreciation of the limits of pharmacogenetics
     is warranted, as pharmacogenetic testing can help in avoiding some, but by
     far not all adverse effects of drug therapy. An analysis of six clinical
     studies correlating adverse thiopurine effects and TPMT genotype revealed
     that an average of 78% of adverse drug reactions were not associated with
     TPMT polymorphisms. Pharmacogenetic testing will thus not eliminate the
     need for careful clinical monitoring of adverse drug reactions. Finally, a
     careful approach toward dose increases for patients with high enzyme
     activity is necessary, as TPMT-mediated methylation of thiopurines
     generates a possibly hepatotoxic byproduct.

PG  - 573-80
AB  - The number of polymorphisms identified in genes encoding drug metabolising
     enzymes, drug transporters, and receptors is rapidly increasing. In many
     cases, these genetic factors have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics
     and pharmacodynamics of a particular drug and thereby influence the
     sensitivity to such drug in an individual patient with a certain genotype.
     The highest impact is seen for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, with
     important examples emerging from treatment with antidepressants, oral
     anticoagulants, and cytostatics, which are metabolised by the polymorphic
     enzymes cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), and
     thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT), respectively. In order to apply the
     increasing amount of pharmacogenetic knowledge to clinical practise,
     specific dosage recommendations based on genotypes will have to be
     developed to guide the clinician, and these recommendations will have to
     be evaluated in prospective clinical studies. Such development will lead
     to a patient-tailored drug therapy which hopefully would be more efficient
     and will result in fewer adverse drug reactions.

AB  - 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its parent drug azathioprine (AZA) have been
     proven to be effective for both steroid-dependent and chronically active,
     or steroid-resistant inflammatory bowel disease, as well as for the
     prevention of relapse. Concerns about toxicity, delayed onset of action,
     and therapeutic failure (1 out of 3 patients) have restricted their use.
     Recent pharmacogenetic advances have led to the development of novel
     strategies to optimize and individualize therapy with AZA and 6-MP,
     maximizing efficacy while minimizing toxicity. We have defined a range of
     optimal therapeutic 6-MP metabolite levels, as well as an association of
     metabolite levels with medication-induced toxicity and the genotype of the
     main catabolic enzyme, thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). Measurement of
     6-MP metabolite levels and TPMT molecular analysis provide clinicians with
     useful tools for optimizing therapeutic response to 6-MP/AZA, as well as
     for identifying individuals at increased risk for drug-induced toxicity.

     toxicity and unpredictable efficacy are hallmarks of cancer therapies. In
     addition, genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes and other
     molecules are responsible for much of the interindividual differences in
     the efficacy and toxicity of many chemotherapy agents. This review will
     discuss clinically relevant examples of gene polymorphisms that influence
     the outcome of cancer therapy, and whole-genome expression studies using
     microarray technology that have shown tremendous potential for benefiting
     cancer pharmacogenomics. The power and utility of the mouse as an
     experimental system for pharmacogenomic discovery will also be discussed
     in the context of cancer therapy.

AB  - There is increasing information available on the existence of
     polymorphisms in genes encoding xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and the
     functional significance of many of these. In addition to genes long
     recognized as being polymorphic, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, there
     is now information available on the existence of polymorphisms in other
     cytochrome P450 genes such as CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. With respect to
     phase II metabolism, polymorphisms in GSTM1, GSTT1, NAT2 and TPMT are well
     understood but information is also emerging on other GST polymorphisms and
     on polymorphisms in the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and
     sulfotransferases. The availability of comprehensive information on the
     occurrence and functional significance of polymorphisms affecting drug
     metabolism should facilitate their application to pharmacogenomic
     profiling.

AB  - Interindividual variability in the efficacy and toxicity of drug therapy
     is associated with polymorphisms in genes encoding drug-metabolizing
     enzymes, transporters, or drug targets. Pharmacogenetics aims to identify
     individuals predisposed to high risk of toxicity from conventional doses
     of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. We review the role of genetic
     polymorphisms in UGT1A1 and TPMT, as well as mutations in DPD, in
     influencing drug disposition and toxicity. Recent studies show that
     pharmacogenetic determinants may also influence treatment outcomes. We
     discuss the clinical significance of polymorphisms in TS, MTHFR, and
     FCGR3A, as well as the polymorphic DNA repair genes XPD and XRCC1, in
     influencing response to chemotherapy and survival outcomes. Finally, the
     potential implications of transporter pharmacogenetics in influencing drug
     bioavailability are addressed.

     withdrawal of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis patients?
PG  - 40-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of thiopurine
     methyltransferase (TPMT) alleles associated with reduced or absent
     activity of thiopurine methyltransferase is a major factor for withdrawal
     of azathioprine (AZA) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. METHODS: The
     TPMT genotype, including the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR)
     pattern in the 5' untranslated region, was analysed in 111 patients with
     long-standing RA. Azathioprine (AZA) therapy was used in 40 patients (36%)
     as a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug. RESULTS: Seven out of 111 RA
     patients (6.3%) were carriers of a mutant allele, TPMT3A (G(460)-->A,
     A(719)-->G) being the mutant allele observed most frequently. In the group
     of 40 AZA-treated patients, therapy was discontinued in six patients
     because of side-effects and in 26 patients because of lack of efficacy.
     Three patients presented moderate side-effects and were homozygous for the
     wild-type TPMT allele, whereas the remaining three patients, who developed
     gastrointestinal effects with severe nausea and vomiting, were TPMT3A
     carriers. CONCLUSION: In this observational study, the absence of
     response, probably due to the low-dose scheme used, was the major cause of
     AZA withdrawal in our series of RA patients. TPMT genotyping may allow the
     use of high doses of AZA in patients with normal TPMT alleles to improve
     the efficacy of this immunosuppressive drug. Our data support the
     relationship between gastrointestinal intolerance and thiopurine metabolic
     imbalance.

     thiopurine s-methyltransferase polymorphisms in patients with
     rheumatological conditions treated with azathioprine.
PG  - 2507-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), which catalyzes the
     inactivation of azathioprine (AZA), exhibits genetic polymorphism that
     results in dose related, serious toxicities (mainly hematological
     cytopenias) in 10-15% of individuals treated with AZA. Polymerase chain
     reaction (PCR) tests provide a sensitive, specific means of prospectively
     identifying these patients before AZA therapy and minimizing toxicity
     through dosage reduction. Our objective was to model the cost
     effectiveness of the 2 alternative AZA treatment strategies in
     rheumatologic conditions: (1) utilizing PCR to determine polymorphisms
     leading to TPMT deficiencies prior to AZA therapy with a reduction in
     dose; and (2) no testing. The analysis was conducted from a third party
     payer perspective over one year. METHODS: A decision analytic model was
     applied to map the costs and outcomes of patients under both strategies.
     Data applied to the model included the positive and negative predictive
     values of the PCR, the probabilities of adverse events due to AZA, and the
     costs associated with their management. Sources of data included published
     clinical trials, diagnostic test evaluations, surveillance trials, and
     economic evaluations. RESULTS: Dose related toxicities resulted in AZA
     discontinuation rates of 10-20%. The usual dosing strategy cost $677 Cdn
     per patient, whereas the genotype directed dosing strategy cost $663 Cdn
     per patient. In the genotype dosing strategy, the number needed to treat
     to avoid one adverse event over 6 months was 20. Thus, the genotype based
     dosing strategy dominated the usual dosing strategy. One-way sensitivity
     analyses revealed that the estimates were robust to ranges of +/- 30% for
     the costs, the properties of the PCR test, and the probability of adverse
     events. CONCLUSION: The introduction of PCR testing to identify TPMT
     polymorphisms prior to AZA treatment may represent good value in certain
     health care settings.

TI  - Canine red blood cell thiopurine S-methyltransferase: companion animal
     pharmacogenetics.
PG  - 713-24
AB  - Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) plays an important role in the
     metabolism of thiopurine drugs. In humans, a common genetic polymorphism
     for TPMT is a major factor responsible for individual variation in the
     toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of these drugs. Dogs (Canis familiaris)
     are also treated with thiopurine drugs and, similar to humans, they
     display large individual variations in thiopurine toxicity and efficacy.
     We set out to determine whether dogs might also display genetically
     determined variation in TPMT activity. As a first step, we observed that
     canine red blood cell (RBC) TPMT activity in samples from 145 dogs varied
     over a nine-fold range. That variation was not associated with either the
     age or sex of the animal. Subsequently, we cloned the canine TPMT cDNA and
     gene. The canine cDNA encoded a protein that was 81.2% identical to the
     enzyme encoded by the most common TPMT allele in humans. A
     genotype-phenotype correlation analysis was performed by resequencing the
     canine gene using DNA samples from 39 animals selected for high, low or
     intermediate levels of RBC TPMT activity. We observed nine polymorphisms
     in these 39 DNA samples, including three insertion/deletion events and six
     single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one of which was a nonsynonymous
     cSNP (Arg97Gln). However, when the variant allozyme at codon 97 was
     expressed in COS-1 cells, it did not display significant differences in
     either basal levels of TPMT activity or in substrate kinetics compared
     with the wild-type allozyme. Six of the nine canine TPMT polymorphisms
     were associated with 67% of the variation in level of RBC TPMT activity in
     these 39 blood samples. When those six SNPs were assayed using DNA from
     all 145 animals studied, 40% of the phenotypic variance in the entire
     population sample could be explained by these polymorphisms. Therefore,
     inheritance is a major factor involved in the regulation of variation in
     RBC TPMT in the dog, just as it is in humans. These observations represent
     a step towards the application of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic
     principles to companion animal drug therapy.

     inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1743-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Azathioprine therapy is discontinued in one-third of patients
     with inflammatory bowel disease because of toxicity or a lack of clinical
     response. Patients with thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency are
     intolerant to azathioprine, whilst carriers are at increased risk of
     side-effects. AIM: To evaluate the importance of TPMT activity in the
     management of azathioprine therapy in inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS:
     Clinical response, adverse effects and haematological parameters were
     determined and correlated with TPMT enzyme activity and genotype in 106
     patients with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients had
     high TPMT activity, and 10 had intermediate activity. Nineteen patients
     (18%) were intolerant to azathioprine. Fifteen (16%) of those with high
     TPMT activity were intolerant, compared with five (50%) with intermediate
     activity [odds ratio (OR), 5.4; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-19.8].
     Complete remission was achieved in 63% of cases, and complete or partial
     remission in 79%. Interestingly, very high TPMT activity (> 14 units/mL
     red blood cells) was significantly associated with non-response,
     irrespective of the time on azathioprine (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.68).
     TPMT gene mutations correlated with TPMT activity. CONCLUSIONS:
     Inflammatory bowel disease patients with intermediate TPMT activity have
     an increased risk of azathioprine toxicity. Conversely, very high TPMT
     activity predicts treatment failure. TPMT genotype predicted TPMT
     phenotype in this study.

     tissue: possible relationship to hypoprothrombinemia.
PG  - 1123-8
AB  - Cephalosporin antibiotics with structures that include the heterocyclic
     leaving group 1-methyltetrazole-5-thiol (MTT) can cause
     hypoprothrombinemia and hemorrhage as a result of MTT-dependent inhibition
     of the gamma-carboxylation of glutamate. The structure of cefazolin also
     includes a heterocyclic thiol, 2-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole-5-thiol (MTD),
     and this compound can also inhibit the gamma-carboxylation of glutamate.
     However, unlike MTT, which is known to be present in vivo after the
     administration of drugs that include this structure, there have been no
     reports that MTD is present in vivo after cefazolin administration. We set
     out to determine whether MTD might be present in the tissues of patients
     treated with cefazolin prior to surgery. To do that, we took advantage of
     the fact that heterocyclic thiols can undergo S-methylation catalyzed by
     the genetically polymorphic drug-metabolizing enzyme thiopurine
     S-methyltransferase (TPMT). Initially, we tested recombinant human TPMT as
     a "reagent" to S-methylate MTD. MTD was a substrate for TPMT-catalyzed
     S-methylation, with an apparent K(m) value of 63 micro M. Recombinant
     TPMT, with [(14)C-methyl]S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a cosubstrate, was
     then used to radioactively label a methyl acceptor substrate present in
     liver and kidney cytosol preparations from patients who had been treated
     preoperatively with cefazolin. Pooled renal cytosol from 10 of those
     patients was used to purify and isolate the methylated product by
     reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. That methylated
     compound coeluted with S-methyl MTD. When the methylated product was
     subjected to tandem mass spectrometry, it was identified as S-methyl MTD.
     Therefore, MTD is present in the tissues of patients treated with
     cefazolin. These observations also raise the possibility that the TPMT
     genetic polymorphism may represent a risk factor for cefazolin-induced
     hypoprothrombinemia since subjects who genetically lack TPMT would be
     unable to catalyze this MTD biotransformation pathway.

TI  - Thiopurine methyltransferase phenotype and genotype in relation to
     azathioprine therapy in autoimmune hepatitis.
PG  - 441-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Toxicity and efficacy of azathioprine is governed partly
     by the activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). Azathioprine has
     been used for many years, with corticosteroids or alone, for the treatment
     of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) but no studies of TPMT phenotype and
     genotype in relation to response to the drug in AIH have been published.
     METHODS: Erythrocyte TPMT activities were measured by a radioincorporation
     assay in 72 consecutive outpatients with AIH, 53 of whom were genotyped
     for the commonest defective alleles in Europeans (TPMT*3A, *3B and *3C) by
     restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: TPMT
     activities were significantly lower in patients intolerant of azathioprine
     (group I, n=15) than in those who sustained remission on azathioprine
     alone (group II, n=28; P=0.003) and those who tolerated azathioprine but
     continued to require corticosteroids (group III, n=29; P<0.0001), and were
     higher in group III than in group II (P=0.034). Ten patients with
     defective alleles (all heterozygotes) had significantly lower TPMT
     activities (P=0.002). However, in 25% there was discordance between
     phenotype and/or genotype and response to azathioprine. CONCLUSIONS: TPMT
     phenotyping or genotyping may be advisable before institution of
     azathioprine therapy in AIH but neither approach invariably predicts
     response to the drug.

     inflammatory bowel disease: impact of thiopurine S-methyltransferase
     polymorphism.
PG  - 429-36
AB  - The efficacy of the immunosuppressants azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine
     has been well established in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases
     (IBD). However, its use has been complicated by a high incidence of
     serious adverse drug reactions such as hematotoxicity, hepatotoxicity,
     pancreatitis and gastrointestinal disturbances. Whereas
     azathioprine-related pancytopenia has been clearly linked to thiopurine
     S-methyltransferase (TPMT) polymorphism limited data are available to
     explain gastrointestinal side effects. In a retrospective analysis of 93
     adults with IBD and azathioprine therapy both phenotyping and genotyping
     was used to explore systematically the relationship between TPMT and
     azathioprine-related adverse reactions. At time of inclusion, 69 patients
     were still receiving azathioprine therapy and had never experienced side
     effects. Azathioprine had been withdrawn in 10 patients for non-medical
     reasons or lack of response and 14 patients (15%) had stopped medication
     or were on reduced dose due to severe azathioprine-related side effects.
     Nine of these 14 patients had developed gastrointestinal side effects
     (hepatotoxicity, n = 3; pancreatitis, n = 3; others, n = 3), but their
     normal red blood cell TPMT activities were in accordance to TPMT
     wild-type. TPMT deficiency in one patient had led to pancytopenia whereas
     only two of the remaining four patients with hematotoxicity displayed an
     intermediate phenotype of TPMT. This study demonstrates that
     azathioprine-related gastrointestinal side effects are independent of the
     TPMT polymorphism. Nevertheless pharmacogenetic testing for TPMT prior to
     commencing thiopurine therapy should become routine practice in order to
     avoid severe hematotoxicity in TPMT deficient patients and lowering the
     incidence of hematological side effects in individuals heterozygous for
     TPMT.

PG  - 451-63
AB  - Clinically important genetic polymorphisms influencing drug metabolism and
     drug response have typically been discovered on the basis of phenotypic
     differences among individuals from different populations. Routine
     genotyping before drug therapy may enable the identification of
     responders, nonresponders, or patients at increased risk of toxicity.
     Automated, high-throughput detecting methods for single-nucleotide
     polymorphisms (SNPs) are highly desirable in many clinical laboratories.
     The aim of this study is to develop a high-throughput genotyping method
     for detecting SNPs influencing drug response in the Japanese population.
     We have developed three real-time PCR assays for detecting SNPs in the
     human drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug targets. The assay for
     simultaneously detecting CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, CYP2D6,
     CYP2E1, CYP3A5, NAT2, TPMT, DPYD, UGT1A1, ALDH2, ADH2, MDR1, CETP, DCP-1,
     ADRB2, HTR2A, INPP1, SDF1, and mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms takes less
     than 1.5 h. With the clinical application of NAT2 genotyping, we found
     statistically significant difference between the incidence of adverse drug
     reactions (ADRs) and the NAT2 genotype. The incidence of the ADRs was
     significantly higher in the slow type than the in other two types, as 5 of
     the 6 patients were of the slowtype, and the other was the
     intermediatetype, while no patients of the rapidtype has developed any
     ADRs.

AB  - Pharmacogenomics, a revolutionary chapter in the history of pharmacology,
     has received new impetus from the development and accessibility of
     molecular biotechnologies, notably DNA chips. The longstanding notion of
     responders/non-responders has given way to a more organic approach, where
     idiosyncrasy becomes an obsolete concept. This is a major step towards
     predictive, individualized medicine. In this review, several applications
     of pharmacogenomics are considered. Genetic polymorphisms of
     metabolization reactions, mainly with cytochrome P450, explain most of the
     cases described today. More fundamental and innovative studies have tried
     to link the structure of receptors or transporters and drug response. A
     leading topic in neuropsychopharmacology is the relation between the
     polymorphism of dopaminergic receptors and the efficacy of, or adverse
     reaction to, neuroleptics. In asthma, the structure of the
     beta2-adrenergic receptor has been associated with response to treatment.
     Intrinsic genetic predisposition also plays an important role in
     cardiovascular diseases, and the role of ion channel mutations will be
     discussed. Research in oncological molecular epidemiology has explored the
     connection between the predisposition to certain cancers and specific
     enzymatic equipment hindering the detoxification of potentially
     carcinogenic exogenous compounds, or, on the contrary, promoting metabolic
     activation implicated in the formation of reactive compounds. The search
     for determinants of addictive behavior is another vast field of
     pharmacogenomics. Finally, we consider the impact of pharmacogenomics on
     the methodology of drug development in preclinical and clinical trials.
     Progress in methods of phenotyping/genotyping should promote diagnosis,
     guide the choice of drug for an individual (benefit/risk ratio), and
     determine dosage and regimen.

     thiopurines and the clinical implications of genetic polymorphism in
     thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT). RESULTS: Intracellularly
     thiopurines, e.g. 6-MP, are anabolized to cytotoxic 6-thioguanine
     nucleotides (6-TGN) that are incorporated into DNA and RNA. A competing
     pathway is S-methylation of 6-MP and its initial nucleotide metabolites by
     TPMT. In childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia, high erythrocyte
     concentrations of 6-TGN correlate with the degree of leukopenia and a good
     prognosis, while low concentrations appear to be associated with higher
     risk of relapse. In most populations studied, approximately 10% have
     intermediate TPMT activity and 1/300 lacks TPMT activity due to one or two
     mutant TPMT alleles, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Phenotyping or
     genotyping may be used to identify patients as deficient or intermediate
     thiopurine metabolizers. This suggests that they should receive a profound
     or moderate reduction in dosage to avoid haematopoietic toxicity.

     activity and metabolite formation during thiopurine therapy: possible role
     of concomitant methotrexate.
PG  - 351-8
AB  - This study examined the role of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)
     polymorphism in the metabolism and clinical effects of azathioprine and
     6-mercaptopurine in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and
     childhood leukemia. The current hypothesis is that the cytotoxic effects
     of thiopurines are caused by the incorporation of thioguanine nucleotides
     into DNA. In this context, S-methylation catalyzed by TPMT can be regarded
     as a competing metabolic pathway. The authors assayed the TPMT activity in
     red blood cells from 122 patients treated with azathioprine or
     6-mercaptopurine (83 adults with inflammatory bowel disease and 39
     children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and in 290 untreated controls
     (219 adult blood donors and 71 children). The concentrations of
     thioguanine nucleotides and methylthioinosine monophosphate were also
     assayed in red blood cells from the patients.The TPMT activity and the
     concentrations of methylthioinosine monophosphate and thioguanine
     nucleotides were higher in children than in adults. All children but no
     adult patient received concomitant methotrexate. Interaction between
     methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine has been described, and may explain the
     results. Low TPMT activity in adult patients with inflammatory bowel
     disease correlated to an increased incidence of adverse drug reactions.
     However, there was no correlation between TPMT activity and the red blood
     cell concentrations of methylthioinosine monophosphate or thioguanine
     nucleotides, or between the concentrations of these metabolites and the
     occurrence of adverse effects. The results show that the role of
     thiopurine metabolism for drug effects is complex.

PG  - 132-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Azathioprine, off-label used long time ago to treat multiple
     sclerosis (MS) patients, has recently received approval from the Spanish
     Medicine Agency (Agencia Espanola del Medicamento) in relapsing-remitting
     (RR) forms of this condition. Clinical efficacy of azathioprine is due to
     the enzymatic conversion to 6-thioguanine (the active metabolite). The key
     enzyme in this process is thio purine methyl transferase (TPMT),
     converting 6-MP to 6-methylMP. A specific genetic polymorphism has been
     described affecting this enzyme. With the aim of optimizing purine therapy
     in a variety of autoimmune diseases, monitoring of TPMT phenotype has been
     performed in a vast number of patients. The TPMT activity frequency
     distribution histogram from a Spanish population sample has been compared
     with the corresponding ones to Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and MS
     patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: TPMT activity has been studied in red blood
     cells obtained from 3,640 clinical laboratory samples in Spain of which
     1,249 corresponded to patients affected by Crohn's disease, 589 to
     ulcerative colitis, 348 to MS, 487 to several autoimmune diseases apart
     from the previously mentioned and 967 to a group of blood donors. The mean
     TPMT activity in the MS group (17.1 6.1 U/ml) was significantly lower (p <
     0.001) than in Crohn's disease (20.0 5.8 U/ml), ulcerative colitis (19.7
     6.1 U/ml) and donors group (19.9 6.3 U/ml). CONCLUSION: Defective
     methylation profile and subsequent hyperhomocysteinemia leading to a
     widespread impairment of the methyl-transferase activity (in this case
     affecting MBP methylation) is a vicious circle we propose as a MS
     susceptibility factor.

AB  - Pharmacogenetics is the study of how genetic variations affect drug
     response. These variations can affect a patient's response to cancer
     drugs, for which there is usually a fine line between a dosage that has a
     therapeutic effect and one that produces toxicity. Gaining better insight
     into the genetic elements of both the patient and the tumour that affect
     drug efficacy will eventually allow for individualized dosage
     determination and fewer adverse effects.

     the clearance of anticancer agents.
PG  - 1515-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacies and toxicities of anticancer agents vary
     greatly among patients. This is attributable to the activities of
     drug-metabolizing enzymes and membrane transporters, primarily determined
     by polymorphisms of the functions of genes encoding these proteins.
     DESIGN: We reviewed the available literature on drug-metabolizing enzymes
     and membrane transporters, especially their physiological functions,
     genetic and functional polymorphisms, and involvement in metabolism,
     pharmacokinetics and toxicity of anticancer agents. RESULTS: Nine enzymes
     metabolizing anticancer agents have been shown to have genetic
     polymorphisms: dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450,
     NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, N-acetyltransferase 2, thiopurine
     methyltransferase, glutathione S-transferase, and uridine diphosphate
     glucuronosyltransferase. Decreased activities of these proteins can cause
     not only inherited metabolic disorders, but also extraordinarily severe
     toxicity in cancer patients given chemothearpy. Transporter proteins
     mediate cellular uptake and secretion of organic anions and cations. These
     proteins have recently been shown to play critical roles in the clearance
     of anticancer agents, although relations between patients' genetics
     backgrounds and the clinical significance of drug actions are poorly
     understood. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies should be focused on dosing and
     selection of anticancer agents, based on the type and extent of metabolic
     variation among individuals, in order to avoid adverse reactions and
     therapeutic failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacogenetics is the science of the influence of heredity
     on pharmacological response. ISSUES: The cost of severe adverse drug
     reactions in individuals has been estimated in the US alone to be in
     excess of US$4 billion. It has been argued that in a significant
     proportion of cases, the efficacy and toxicity profiles of drug therapy
     would be substantially improved in individuals if characteristics due to
     genetic variation were taken into account. Methods are now available,
     which make screening for susceptibility feasible. CONCLUSIONS: There are
     several therapeutic areas in which screening may give rise to significant
     improvements in outcome with cost-benefits to both the individual and the
     community. However, there is currently a lack of data on which
     cost-benefit analysis can be based. The challenge is to provide this
     information for new drugs, and for drugs with established therapeutic
     roles.

     metabolic polymorphisms. Clinically relevant examples include acetylator
     status; cytochrome P450 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19 polymorphisms; and thiopurine
     methyltransferase deficiency. It is important to be aware of which drugs
     are subject to pharmacogenetic variability. In the future,
     population-based pharmacogenetic testing will allow more individualized
     drug treatment and will avoid the current empiricism.

     drug response.
PG  - 9-39
AB  - It is well recognized that most medications exhibit wide interpatient
     variability in their efficacy and toxicity. For many medications, these
     interindividual differences are due in part to polymorphisms in genes
     encoding drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and/or drug targets
     (e.g., receptors, enzymes). Pharmacogenomics is a burgeoning field aimed
     at elucidating the genetic basis for differences in drug efficacy and
     toxicity, and it uses genome-wide approaches to identify the network of
     genes that govern an individual's response to drug therapy. For some
     genetic polymorphisms (e.g., thiopurine S-methyltransferase), monogenic
     traits have a marked effect on pharmacokinetics (e.g., drug metabolism),
     such that individuals who inherit an enzyme deficiency must be treated
     with markedly different doses of the affected medications (e.g., 5%-10% of
     the standard thiopurine dose). Likewise, polymorphisms in drug targets
     (e.g., beta adrenergic receptor) can alter the sensitivity of patients to
     treatment (e.g., beta-agonists), changing the pharmacodynamics of drug
     response. Recognizing that most drug effects are determined by the
     interplay of several gene products that govern the pharmacokinetics and
     pharmacodynamics of medications, pharmacogenomics research aims to
     elucidate these polygenic determinants of drug effects. The ultimate goal
     is to provide new strategies for optimizing drug therapy based on each
     patient's genetic determinants of drug efficacy and toxicity. This chapter
     provides an overview of the current pharmacogenomics literature and offers
     insights for the potential impact of this field on the safe and effective
     use of medications.

     infectious episodes during maintenance therapy for childhood lymphoblastic
     leukemia with mercaptopurine.
PG  - 1706-12
AB  - 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) is metabolized by thiopurine S-methyltransferase
     (TPMT), an enzyme subject to genetic polymorphism. We investigated the
     relationships between the TPMT locus (TPMT activity and genotype) and the
     pharmacological response to 6-MP during maintenance therapy of 78 children
     with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). For each patient, 6-MP dosage,
     leukocyte counts and occurrence of infectious episodes were monitored on
     an 8 week basis. Higher 6-MP dosage was associated with higher TPMT
     activity (P = 0.03) and higher average leukocyte counts (P < 0.01). Eight
     patients (10%) carrying a TPMT mutant genotype (one homozygous and seven
     heterozygous) received lower 6-MP doses (average: 48 vs 65 mg/m2/day; P =
     0.02) and had on average lower leukocyte counts (2834 vs 3398 cells/mm3; P
     = 0.003) than patients carrying the wild-type TPMT genotype. Higher
     occurrence of infectious episodes graded 2 or 3 was correlated with higher
     6-MP dosage (P < 0.01) but no difference was observed between TPMT mutants
     and TPMT wild-type patients. Patients who received 6-MP dosage above the
     group median (62 mg/m2/day) or having a TPMT activity above the group
     median (21.5 nmol/h/ml) had a higher percentage of 8 week periods with
     infectious episodes requiring treatment (34% vs 17% and 33% vs 19%,
     respectively) than those with 6-MP dose or TPMT activity below the group
     median (P < 0.01). In the last 25 patients enrolled in the study,
     steady-state erythrocyte thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) concentrations were
     associated with lower leukocyte counts (P= 0.01) but not with a higher
     occurrence of infectious episodes. In contrast, higher steady-state
     erythrocyte methylmercaptopurine nucleotide (MeMPN) concentrations were
     associated with higher 6-MP dosage (P< 0.01) and higher occurrence of
     infectious episodes (P < 0.001). In conclusion, during maintenance therapy
     of ALL, children with higher TPMT activity receive a higher 6-MP dosage
     and may have infectious episodes caused by metabolism of 6-MP into
     methylmercaptopurine nucleotides.

TI  - Differing contribution of thiopurine methyltransferase to mercaptopurine
     versus thioguanine effects in human leukemic cells.
PG  - 5810-6
AB  - Thioguanine and mercaptopurine are prodrugs requiring conversion into
     thiopurine nucleotides to exert cytotoxicity. Thiopurine
     S-methyltransferase (TPMT), an enzyme subject to genetic polymorphism,
     catabolizes thiopurines into inactive methylated bases, but also produces
     methylthioguanine nucleotides and methylmercaptopurine nucleotides from
     thioguanine and mercaptopurine nucleotides, respectively. To study the
     effect of TPMT on activation versus inactivation of mercaptopurine and
     thioguanine, we used a retroviral gene transfer technique to develop human
     CCRF-CEM cell lines that did (TPMT+) and did not (MOCK) overexpress TPMT.
     After transduction, TPMT activities were 14-fold higher in the TPMT+
     versus the MOCK cell lines (P < 0.001). TPMT+ cells were less sensitive to
     thioguanine than MOCK cells (IC(50) = 1.10+/- 0.12 microM versus 0.55 +/-
     0.19 microM; P = 0.02); in contrast, TPMT+ cells were more sensitive to
     mercaptopurine than MOCK cells (IC(50) = 0.52 +/- 0.20 microM versus 1.50
     +/- 0.23 microM; P < 0.01). The lower sensitivity of TPMT+ versus MOCK
     cells to thioguanine was associated with lower thioguanine nucleotide
     concentrations (917 +/- 282 versus 1515 +/- 183 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells; P =
     0.01), higher methylthioguanine nucleotide concentrations (252 +/- 34
     versus 27 +/- 10 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells; P = 0.01), less inhibition of de
     novo purine synthesis (13 versus 95%; P < 0.01), and lower
     deoxythioguanosine incorporation into DNA (2.0 +/- 0.6% versus 7.2 +/-
     2.0%; P < 0.001). The higher sensitivity of TPMT+ cells to mercaptopurine
     was associated with higher concentrations of methylmercaptopurine
     nucleotide (2601 +/- 1055 versus 174 +/- 77 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells; P =
     0.01) and greater inhibition of de novo purine synthesis (>99% versus 74%;
     P < 0.01) compared with MOCK cells. We conclude that methylation of
     mercaptopurine contributes to the antiproliferative properties of the
     drug, probably through inhibition of de novo purine synthesis by
     methylmercaptopurine nucleotides, whereas thioguanine is inactivated
     primarily by TPMT.

     heterozygosity among patients intolerant to mercaptopurine or
     azathioprine.
PG  - 2293-301
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) phenotype and
     genotype in patients who were intolerant to treatment with mercaptopurine
     (MP) or azathioprine (AZA), and to evaluate their clinical management.
     PATIENTS AND METHODS: TPMT phenotype and thiopurine metabolism were
     assessed in all patients referred between 1994 and 1999 for evaluation of
     excessive toxicity while receiving MP or AZA. TPMT activity was measured
     by radiochemical analysis, TPMT genotype was determined by
     mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length
     polymorphism analyses for the TPMT*2, *3A, *3B, and *3C alleles, and
     thiopurine metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid
     chromatography. RESULTS: Of 23 patients evaluated, six had TPMT deficiency
     (activity < 5 U/mL of packed RBCs [pRBCs]; homozygous mutant), nine had
     intermediate TPMT activity (5 to 13 U/mL of pRBCs; heterozygotes), and
     eight had high TPMT activity (> 13.5 U/mL of pRBCs; homozygous wildtype).
     The 65.2% frequency of TPMT-deficient and heterozygous individuals among
     these toxic patients is significantly greater than the expected 10%
     frequency in the general population (P <.001, chi(2)). TPMT phenotype and
     genotype were concordant in all TPMT-deficient and all homozygous-wildtype
     patients, whereas five patients with heterozygous phenotypes did not have
     a TPMT mutation detected. Before thiopurine dosage adjustments,
     TPMT-deficient patients experienced more frequent hospitalization, more
     platelet transfusions, and more missed doses of chemotherapy. Hematologic
     toxicity occurred in more than 90% of patients, whereas hepatotoxicity
     occurred in six patients (26%). Both patients who presented with only
     hepatic toxicity had a homozygous-wildtype TPMT phenotype. After
     adjustment of thiopurine dosages, the TPMT-deficient and heterozygous
     patients tolerated therapy without acute toxicity. CONCLUSION: There is a
     significant (> six-fold) overrepresentation of TPMT deficiency or
     heterozygosity among patients developing dose-limiting hematopoietic
     toxicity from therapy containing thiopurines. However, with appropriate
     dosage adjustments, TPMT-deficient and heterozygous patients can be
     treated with thiopurines, without acute dose-limiting toxicity.

AB  - Thiopurine drugs are used to treat patients with neoplasia and autoimmune
     disease as well as transplant recipients. These agents are metabolized, in
     part, by S-methylation catalyzed by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT).
     The discovery nearly two decades ago that levels of TPMT activity in human
     tissues are controlled by a common genetic polymorphism led to one of the
     best examples of the potential importance of pharmacogenetics for clinical
     medicine. Specifically, it is now known that patients with inherited very
     low levels of TPMT activity are at greatly increased risk for
     thiopurine-induced toxicity such as myelosuppression when treated with
     standard doses of these drugs, while subjects with very high activity may
     be undertreated. Furthermore, recent reports indicate that TPMT may be the
     target for clinically significant drug interactions and that this common
     genetic polymorphism might be a risk factor for the occurrence of
     therapy-dependent secondary leukemia. In parallel with these clinical
     reports, the molecular basis for the TPMT polymorphism has been determined
     as a result of cloning and characterization of the human TPMT cDNA and
     gene. Those advances led to the description and characterization of a
     series of single nucleotide polymorphisms that result in low levels of
     enzyme activity as well as a polymorphic variable number tandem repeat
     within the 5'-flanking region of the TPMT gene that may "modulate" level
     of enzyme activity. As a result of these observations, the TPMT genetic
     polymorphism represents a model system for the way in which basic
     pharmacogenetic information is developed and applied to clinical medicine.

AB  - The level of expression of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)
     is an important determinant of the metabolism of drugs used both in the
     treatment of acute leukaemia (6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine) and as
     an immunosuppressant in patients with autoimmune diseases or following
     organ transplantation (azathioprine). Studies of enzyme activity in red
     blood cells have shown that TPMT expression displays genetic polymorphism
     with 11% of individuals having intermediate and one in 300 undetectable
     levels. Patients with biallelic mutations and undetectable enzyme activity
     suffer life-threatening myelosuppression when treated with conventional
     doses of these drugs. Patients with intermediate activity have an
     increased risk of drug-associated toxicity. In the Caucasian populations
     studied to date, intermediate activity is associated with mutations at two
     sites of the TPMT gene, G460A and A719G (designated TPMT*3A), in 80% of
     cases. Detection of these mutations has, to date, been based on the
     analysis of restriction digests of PCR products. In order to simplify this
     process we have investigated the ability of denaturing high pressure
     liquid chromatography (DHPLC) to detect the A719G mutation. DHPLC of PCR
     products from 15 known heterozygotes (TPMT*3A/TPMT*1) and 18 known
     homozygotes (TPMT*1/TPMT*1) gave a clear pattern difference between the
     groups and 100% concordance with the results of restriction digests. These
     results suggest DHPLC represents a valuable technique for accurate and
     rapid detection of pharmacologically important mutations in the TPMT gene.

     knowledge of drug metabolism and transport.
PG  - 869-76
AB  - Significant fractions of health budgets must be spent for treatment of
     drug side effects and for inefficient drug therapy. Hereditary variants in
     drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and drug targets are
     important determinants of drug response and toxicity and may therefore aid
     in selection and dosage of drugs. Today there is extensive knowledge of
     genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, and
     2D6; of phase-2 enzymes such as thiopurine S-methyltransferase; and more
     recently of drug transporters such as the MDR-1 gene-product
     P-glycoprotein, affecting a significant share of currently used drugs.
     However, application of pharmacogenetic knowledge to clinical routine is
     limited in current practice. To promote the application of pharmacogenetic
     knowledge in clinical routine, research on genotype-based dose adjustments
     is still necessary - as is the promotion of faster and cheaper genotype
     analyses. Furthermore, the benefits of CYP genotype-directed drug therapy
     should be evaluated in properly designed prospective studies. Once such
     steps have been successfully taken, drug therapy could well become more
     prevention-directed and patient-tailored than it is possible today,
     replacing the current "one drug in one dose for one disease" strategy by a
     more individualized approach.

     methyltransferase genetic polymorphism]
PG  - 299-301
AB  - BACKGROUND: Azathioprine is an immunosuppressor drug widely used in the
     treatment of autoimmune diseases. Adverse effects during treatment are
     related to the activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), an enzyme
     which plays a role in azathioprine metabolism. The presence of the allelic
     variants of the TPMT gene allows us to classify patients into three
     different groups: high, moderate and low risk of myelosuppression after
     receiving standard doses of azathioprine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study of
     the allelic variants of the TPMT gene in the positions 460 and 719 with
     PCR methods in a patient with Crohn's disease, who developed aplasia after
     receiving azathioprine. The study was extended to his relatives. RESULTS:
     The patient under study carried the most frequent variant allele of the
     TPMT gene associated with low enzymatic activity. The mother and one
     sister of the patient were also carriers of this allelic variant.
     CONCLUSIONS: Genotyping the allelic variants of the TPMT gene is a useful
     method to identify patients at moderate or high risk of myelosuppression
     after administration of azathioprine.

AB  - We have developed an allele-specific fluorogenic 5' nuclease chain
     reaction assay for detecting polymorphisms in the following human
     drug-metabolizing enzyme genes: CYP2C9 (CYP2C9*2 and *3), CYP2C19
     (CYP2C19*2 and *3), CYP2D6 (CYP2D6*4, *10, *14, *18, and *21(C8)),
     N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2*5B, *6A, and *7B), thiopurine
     methyltransferase (TPMT*3C), and aldehyde dehydrogenase2 (ALDH2*2). This
     method is a marriage of two emerging technologies, the use of
     allele-specific amplification primers for target DNA and hybridization of
     the TaqMan probe. The TaqMan probe is labeled with both a fluorescent
     reporter dye and a quencher dye. Genotypes are separated according to the
     different threshold cycles of the wild-type and mutant primers. All assays
     are performed using a single thermocycling protocol. This genotyping
     method is rapid and highly sensitive and yields a high throughput. It
     could be applied toward automated large-scale genotyping.

PG  - 552-4
AB  - Azathioprine is a purine analogue used as an immunosuppressive and
     immunomodulator agent in various mammals, including cats. Several adverse
     reactions have been reported and have limited the use of the drug in the
     cat. Adverse reactions to azathioprine in humans have been correlated with
     reduced activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) in erythrocytes.
     The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine if cats have TPMT
     activity in their erythrocytes and to compare the values obtained with the
     normal range for humans and the normal range for dogs in a preliminary
     report. Activity of the enzyme was measured in blood samples drawn from 41
     cats. Blood also was taken from 5 dogs. The mean erythrocyte TPMT activity
     in the cats was 2.4 +/- 0.4 nmol (range, 1.2-3.9 nmol) per hour per
     milliliter of red blood cells (U/mL RBC) or 2-8 nmol per hour per gram of
     hemoglobin (U/g Hb). This range was far lower than the normal human range
     (8-15 U/mL RBC; 16-33 U/g Hb) and was of monopolar distribution. This
     observation apparently precludes any diagnostic purpose in assaying
     erythrocyte TPMT in this species. Erythrocyte TPMT activity in the 5 dogs
     ranged from 5.5 to 13.1 U/mL RBC (11-27 U/g Hb), which was comparable with
     normal and carrier ranges for humans, but proof of TPMT genetic
     polymorphism in either species will require genotyping studies.

     thiopurine methyltransferase mutations.
PG  - 599-604
AB  - S-Methylation by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is an important route
     of metabolism for the thiopurine drugs. About one in 300 individuals are
     homozygous for a TPMT mutation associated with very low enzyme activity
     and severe myelosuppression if treated with standard doses of drug. To
     validate the use of molecular genetic techniques for the detection of TPMT
     deficiency, we have determined red blood cell TPMT activity in 240 adult
     blood donors and 55 normal children. Genotype was determined by
     restriction fragment length analysis of polymerase chain reaction products
     in a cohort of 79 of the blood donors and five cases of
     azathioprine-induced myelosupression, and this confirmed a close
     relationship between genotype and phenotype. In 17 of the 24 cases in
     which mutations were found, DNA was also available from remission bone
     marrow. In one of these cases, DNA from the remission marrow sample
     indicated the presence of a non-mutated allele that had not been seen in
     the blast DNA sample obtained at presentation. These results indicate that
     polymerase chain reaction-based assays give reliable and robust results
     for the detection of TPMT deficiency, but that caution should be exercised
     in relying exclusively on DNA obtained from lymphoblasts in childhood
     leukaemia.

TI  - Genetic polymorphism of thiopurine S-methyltransferase: molecular
     mechanisms and clinical importance.
PG  - 136-46
AB  - The activity of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is inherited as an
     autosomal co-dominant trait. In most large world populations studied to
     date, approximately 10% of the population have intermediate activity due
     to heterozygosity at the TPMT locus, and about 0.33% is TPMT deficient.
     TPMT is now one of the most well characterized genetic polymorphisms of
     drug metabolism, with the genetic basis having been well defined in most
     populations, providing molecular strategies for studying this genetic
     polymorphism in human and experimental models. Three mutant alleles,
     TPMT(*)2, TPMT(*)3A and TPMT(*)3C, account for the great majority of
     mutant alleles in all human populations studied to date. Significant
     ethnic differences occur in the frequencies of these mutant alleles.
     Progress in DNA analysis has made it practical to use genotyping
     techniques for the molecular diagnosis of TPMT deficiency and
     heterozygosity, thereby avoiding adverse effects that are more prevalent
     in TPMT-deficient and heterozygous patients prescribed thiopurine
     medications.

TI  - Thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene polymorphism is predictive of
     azathioprine-induced myelosuppression in heart transplant recipients.
PG  - 1524-7
AB  - Azathioprine (AZA) is metabolized via the cytosolic enzyme thiopurine
     S-methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT activity exhibits genetic polymorphism
     with four prevalent (75%) mutant alleles TPMT*2 (G238C) and TPMT*3 (A719G
     and/or G460A) and a wild-type allele TPMT*1. To test the hypothesis that
     presence of these mutations is associated with greater toxicity of AZA in
     heart transplant recipients, 30 consecutive patients treated with AZA were
     followed up for the first month after heart transplant. Mutation of TPMT
     gene (mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction-based methods) was
     observed in four patients (A719G: n = 2; A719G plus G460: n = 2).
     Agranulocytosis did not occur in patients with the wild genotype. It
     occurred in the two patients with mutation A719G and there was a 40% drop
     in neutrophils in the two other patients. Discontinuation of AZA in the
     four mutant patients corrected for the drop. Presence of TPMT mutations is
     associated with a greater likelihood of agranulocytosis. Determination of
     these mutations could reduce the risk for hematological side-effects.

TI  - Genetic polymorphism of thiopurine methyltransferase and its clinical
     relevance for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG  - 567-72
AB  - Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyses the S-methylation of
     thiopurines, including 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine. TPMT activity
     exhibits genetic polymorphism, with about 1/300 inheriting TPMT deficiency
     as an autosomal recessive trait. If treated with standard doses of
     thiopurines, TPMTdeficient patients accumulate excessive thioguanine
     nucleotides in hematopoietic tissues, leading to severe hematological
     toxicity that can be fatal. However, TPMT-deficient patients can be
     successfully treated with a 10- to 15-fold lower dosage of these
     medications. The molecular basis for altered TPMT activity has been
     defined, with rapid and inexpensive assays available for the three
     signature mutations which account for the majority of mutant alleles. TPMT
     genotype correlates well with in vivo enzyme activity within erythrocytes
     and leukemic blast cells and is clearly associated with risk of toxicity.
     The impact of 6-mercaptopurine dose intensity is also being clarified as
     an important determinate of event-free survival in childhood leukemia. In
     addition, there are emerging data that TPMT genotype may influence the
     risk of secondary malignancies, including brain tumors and acute
     myelogenous leukemia. Ongoing studies aim to clarify the influence of TPMT
     on thiopurine efficacy, acute toxicity, and risk for delayed toxicity.
     Together, these advances hold the promise of improving the safety and
     efficacy of thiopurine therapy.

PG  - 628-32
AB  - The risk of azathioprine-induced myelosuppression can be predicted by
     detecting patients with intermediate or low thiopurine methyltransferase
     (TPMT) activity. Population studies have shown that 89% of whites have
     high TPMT activity, 11% have intermediate TPMT activity, and 0.3% have low
     TPMT activity. Three specific mutations in the TPMT gene that cause
     decreased TPMT activity have recently been identified. Patients homozygous
     for the TPMT mutations have low TPMT activity, and patients heterozygous
     for TPMT mutations have intermediate TPMT activity. This has led to the
     development of a technique for TPMT genotype analysis that will identify
     patients at risk of azathioprine-induced myelosuppression. We report a
     case of a patient with bullous pemphigoid who experienced
     azathioprine-induced myelosuppression and who was later found to be
     homozygous for TPMT mutant alleles. Using the cost of treatment required
     for this patient and the estimated population prevalence of TPMT
     mutations, we examined the cost impact of screening for TPMT mutations in
     all patients being considered for azathioprine therapy. We calculated that
     screening is cost-neutral assuming patients homozygous for TPMT mutations
     experience myelosuppression, and that it is cost-beneficial assuming
     patients heterozygous for TPMT mutations also experience myelosuppression
     while receiving azathioprine. Screening patients for TPMT mutations will
     reduce the risk of azathioprine-induced myelosuppression, and our study
     suggests that it may also be a cost-attractive strategy.

AB  - Azathioprine, a cytostatic and immunosuppressive drug in use for some 30
     years, can give rise to life-threatening neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
     This may be caused by unexpectedly high concentrations of cytotoxic
     metabolites due to abnormally slow inactivation of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)
     by thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and/or xanthine oxidase. Low TPMT
     activity may be due to genetic polymorphism or interaction with drugs such
     as salicylic acid derivatives, while xanthine oxidase may be inhibited by
     allopurinol. High TPMT activity, on the other hand, may hamper cytostatic
     treatment. Safer and more effective treatment with azathioprine and its
     metabolite 6-MP becomes possible with new laboratory methods for
     pharmacotherapy monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical laboratory forms an essential bridge between
     fundamental discoveries in biological sciences and their transition into
     effective medical practice. The genetic basis for individuality in drug
     metabolism and response is the result of a finite number of inherited
     sequence variants (alleles) of genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes
     and drug receptors. Pharmacogenetics (PG) links differences in gene
     structure with pharmacological differences in pharmacokinetics and
     pharmacodynamics. The next step in the process of applying PG (or
     pharmacogenomic) information to individualized therapeutic management is
     dissemination of this information to practicing physicians by clinical
     laboratorians. Transitioning PG analysis into clinical practice will
     require professionals in laboratory medicine to identify relevant
     polymorphisms, develop sensitive and specific testing strategies, and, in
     conjunction with physicians and pharmacologists, communicate interpretive
     guidelines regarding appropriate indications for testing and rational dose
     adjustment. We review these concepts and provide examples of how PG can be
     applied to support therapeutic decision making.

AB  - Pharmacogenetics has emerged as a novel and challenging area of interest
     in oncology. Cancer chemotherapy is characterized by major intersubject
     variability in tumor responses and host toxicity. This variation may be
     caused by genetic differences in the enzymes involved in the metabolism of
     anticancer agents. Anticancer agents, such as 6-mercaptopurine,
     5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan, have a narrow therapeutic index that can
     sometimes result in severe life-threatening toxicities. The impact of
     polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes (thiopurine S-methyltransferase,
     dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, and uridine diphosphate
     glucuronosyltransferase) that participate significantly in the disposition
     of these anticancer agents is discussed.

     Japanese.
PG  - 944-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is a cytosolic enzyme
     that preferentially catalyzes the S-methylation of aromatic and
     heterocyclic sulfhydryl compounds, including Azathioprine (AZA). It has
     been reported that the level of AZA toxicity is dependent on the TPMT
     genotypes in Caucasian individuals; we thus investigated this relationship
     in Japanese. METHODS: The TPMT genotype was determined using peripheral
     blood cell DNA obtained from 36 Japanese patients with rheumatic diseases
     who were treated with AZA, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.
     Duration of AZA administration, white blood cell counts before and after
     AZA administration, and side effects were investigated in each subject,
     and were compared between the patients with or without TPMT mutation.
     RESULTS: The TPMT allelotype was TPMT*1/TPMT*1 in 33 (91.7%) and
     TPMT*1/TPMT*3C in 3 (8.3%) individuals. All 3 patients (100%) with the
     mutant TPMT allele (TPMT*3C) discontinued AZA treatment due to leucopenia
     while only 4 patients (12%) without mutant TPMT alleles showed leucopenia
     (p=0.0049, Fisher's exact test). However, leucopenia developed relatively
     late in patients with mutant TPMT. CONCLUSION: The TPMT mutant allele,
     TPMT*3C, also exists in Japanese individuals, and the bone marrow toxicity
     of AZA is likely stronger in patients with this mutant allele.

     S-methyltransferase gene locus.
PG  - 2001-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia are often treated
     with 6-mercaptopurine, and those with homozygous deficiency in thiopurine
     S-methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity have an extreme sensitivity to
     this drug as a result of the accumulation of higher cellular
     concentrations of thioguanine nucleotides. We studied the metabolism, dose
     requirements, and tolerance of 6-mercaptopurine among patients with
     different TPMT phenotypes. METHODS: We compared, by use of statistical
     modeling, 6-mercaptopurine pharmacology and tolerance in 180 patients who
     achieved remission on St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Protocol Total
     XII composed of weekly methotrexate (40 mg/m(2)) and daily oral
     6-mercaptopurine (75 mg/m(2)) given for 2.5 years, interrupted every 6
     weeks during the first year for treatment with either high-dose
     methotrexate or teniposide plus cytarabine. Statistical tests were
     two-sided. RESULTS: Erythrocyte concentrations of thioguanine nucleotides
     (pmol/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes) were inversely related to TPMT enzyme
     activity (P<.01), with averages (+/- standard deviations) of 417 (+/-179),
     963 (+/-752), and 3565 (+/-1282) in TPMT homozygous wild-type (n = 161),
     heterozygous (n = 17), and homozygous-deficient (n = 2) patients,
     respectively. There was complete concordance between TPMT genotype and
     phenotype in a subset of 28 patients for whom TPMT genotype was
     determined. There were no sex differences in thioguanine nucleotide
     concentrations (P =.24), TPMT enzyme activity (P =.22), or average weekly
     prescribed dose of 6-mercaptopurine (P=.49). The cumulative incidence of
     6-mercaptopurine dose reductions due to toxicity was highest among
     patients homozygous for mutant TPMT (100%), intermediate among
     heterozygous patients (35%), and lowest among wild-type patients (7%)
     (P<.001), with average (+/- standard deviation) final weekly
     6-mercaptopurine doses of 72 (+/-60), 449 (+/-160), and 528 (+/-90)
     mg/m(2), respectively. Lowering doses of 6-mercaptopurine in TPMT
     heterozygotes and in deficient patients allowed administration of full
     protocol doses of other chemotherapy while maintaining high thioguanine
     nucleotide concentrations. CONCLUSION: We conclude that genetic
     polymorphism in TPMT is an important determinant of mercaptopurine
     toxicity, even among patients who are heterozygous for this trait.

     cells: relation to thiopurine metabolism.
PG  - 1080-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: 6-Mercaptopurine (6MP) has been regarded as nonleukemogenic,
     even though the cytotoxicity of 6MP depends on the incorporation of
     6-thioguanine nucleotides (6TGN) into DNA. In hematopoietic cells this
     pathway competes with S-methylation catalyzed by thiopurine
     methyltransferase (TPMT). However, methylated 6MP metabolites inhibit
     purine de novo synthesis and thus may enhance incorporation of 6TGN into
     DNA. Approximately 10% of white individuals have low TPMT activity as a
     result of polymorphisms in the TPMT gene. The authors attempted to test
     the hypothesis that the degree of DNA damage during 6MP therapy might
     reflect variations in 6MP metabolism and pharmacokinetics. METHODS: The
     authors measured TPMT activity as well as erythrocyte levels of 6TGN
     (E-6TGN) and methylated 6MP metabolites (E-MeMP) during 6MP therapy in 439
     children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 5 of whom later developed
     secondary myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia (sMDS/AML). RESULTS:
     The patients who developed sMDS/AML had significantly lower TPMT activity
     compared with the remaining patients (P = 0.03). The 55 patients with TPMT
     activity <14 U/mL red blood cells (RBC) (antimode of the bimodal
     distribution) had a 5-year risk of sMDS/AML of 9 +/- 6% versus 1 +/- 1%
     for the remaining patients (P = 0.002). Cox regression analysis identified
     TPMT activity and E-MeMP level as the strongest predictors of risk for
     sMDS/AML (global P value = 0.02). Patients with low TPMT activity and high
     E-MeMP levels had the highest risk. All 5 patients with sMDS/AML had
     E-6TGN and/or E-MeMP levels > the 90% percentiles or had TPMT activity <
     14 U/mL RBC. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate an increased leukemogenic
     risk when 6MP is administered with other cytotoxic agents in patients with
     low TPMT activity, and indicate that not only high 6TGN levels but also
     high levels of methylated metabolites may lead to DNA damage.

PG  - 640-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of polymorphisms associated
     with reduced or absent activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), an
     enzyme involved in azathioprine metabolism, can predict side-effects,
     particularly myelosuppression, in patients taking this drug. METHODS: The
     TPMT genotype was determined in 120 patients with systemic lupus
     erythematosus (SLE) together with 15 patients with inflammatory bowel
     disease (IBD) and correlated with the effects of clinical exposure to
     azathioprine. RESULTS: TPMT polymorphisms were detected in eight patients.
     Severe marrow toxicity occurred in the single homozygote identified.
     Azathioprine was generally well tolerated, but 11 drug-associated
     neutropenias were detected. In only one of the 11 cases was a TPMT
     polymorphism identified. CONCLUSION: Homozygous TPMT deficiency was
     associated with severe marrow suppression. In the majority of cases,
     however, TPMT genotyping prior to azathioprine therapy would not have
     predicted myelosuppressive events and may augment, but not replace,
     regular blood monitoring.

TI  - Thiopurine methyltransferase pharmacogenetics: alternative molecular
     diagnosis and preliminary data from Northern Portugal.
PG  - 257-61
AB  - The thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genetic polymorphism has been
     shown to have a highly significant clinical impact, namely in the
     therapeutic efficiency of thiopurine drugs used in the treatment of a wide
     range of diseases. Available diagnostic methods, although reproducible and
     sensitive, are relatively laborious. Thus population studies are still
     very scarce. In this work we describe a new polymerase chain
     reaction-single strand confirmational analysis based protocol for TPMT
     specific detection which introduces a substantial technical simplification
     avoiding the use of restriction enzyme treatment after polymerase chain
     reaction amplification. Additionally, the use of this protocol allows the
     simultaneous detection of a T474 to C substitution, a frequent silent
     mutation in the North Portuguese population (TPMT*1S = 0.215). In a sample
     of 310 unrelated Northern Portuguese individuals, 15 were found to be
     heterozygous for the TPMT*3A allele (defined by the presence of two
     transitions, G460 to A and A719 to G) which is associated with TPMT
     enzymatic deficiency; the corresponding gene frequency estimate was 0.024.
     We also attempted to evaluate the relationship between the molecular TPMT
     genotype and the reaction to treatments involving thiopurine drugs by
     analysing a sample of 24 children submitted to curative therapy of acute
     lymphoblastic leukaemia. Four of them were shown to be heterozygous for
     the TPMT*3A allele. An examination of their clinical histories showed that
     all four patients exhibited signs of severe hepatic toxicity during
     treatment.

     lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is well established. However, the efficacy
     of 6MP is significantly influenced by inactivation by the polymorphic
     enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). In the general population
     89-94% have high TPMT activity, 6-11% have intermediate activity, and
     approximately 0.3% have low activity. Individuals with low-activity
     experience severe or fatal toxicity with standard 6MP doses. Prospective
     identification of this group of patients might prevent this problem.
     Recent identification of the molecular basis for low TPMT activity enabled
     rapid assessment of altered 6MP metabolism by PCR methods. This study
     evaluated the frequency of mutant TPMT alleles in 147 children with ALL.
     One patient was homozygous mutant (0.7%), and 16 patients were
     heterozygous for variant TPMT alleles (10.9%). The majority of mutant
     alleles were TPMT*3A. Both the allele frequency and the pattern of TPMT
     mutations were similar to that observed in an adult British population.
     The number of weeks when 6MP therapy was administered at full dose was
     determined in patients on MRC UKALL X and XI. The 94 patients spent a
     median 11% of the maintenance period receiving no therapy as a result of
     haematological toxicity. There was no significant difference in the number
     of weeks when no therapy could be administered among patients with a
     wild-type or heterozygous genotype. However, the one patient with a
     homozygous mutant genotype had severe haematological toxicity and no
     therapy could be administered for 53% of the maintenance period. This
     study demonstrates that 11.6% of the children had variant TPMT alleles.
     Prospective identification of TPMT genotype may be a promising tool for
     decreasing excessive haematological toxicity in individuals with low
     activity.

AB  - Methyl conjugation is an important pathway in the biotransformation of
     many exogenous and endogenous compounds. Pharmacogenetic studies of
     methyltransferase enzymes have resulted in the identification and
     characterization of functionally important common genetic polymorphisms
     for catechol O-methyltransferase, thiopurine methyltransferase, and
     histamine N-methyltransferase. In recent years, characterization of these
     genetic polymorphisms has been extended to include the cloning of cDNAs
     and genes, as well as a determination of the molecular basis for the
     effects of inheritance on these methyltransferase enzymes. The thiopurine
     methyltransferase genetic polymorphism is responsible for clinically
     significant individual variations in the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy
     of thiopurine drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine. Phenotyping for the
     thiopurine methyltransferase genetic polymorphism represents one of the
     first examples in which testing for a pharmacogenetic variant has entered
     standard clinical practice. The full functional implications of
     pharmacogenetic variation in the activities of catechol
     O-methyltransferase and histamine N-methyltransferase remain to be
     determined. Finally, experimental strategies used to study methylation
     pharmacogenetics illustrate the rapid evolution of biochemical,
     pharmacologic, molecular, and genomic approaches that have been used to
     determine the role of inheritance in variation in drug metabolism, effect,
     and toxicity.

AB  - Genetic polymorphism of drug metabolizing enzymes can be the major
     determinant of inter-individual differences in drug disposition and
     effects. In this mini-review, the evolution of pharmacogenetic studies,
     from the recognition of phenotypic polymorphisms to the discovery of
     genetic mutations responsible for these inherited traits, is illustrated
     by the genetic polymorphism of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT).
     TPMT, which exhibits autosomal co-dominant polymorphism, plays an
     important role in metabolism of the antileukemic and immunosuppressive
     medications, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, and azathioprine. The genetic
     polymorphism of TPMT activity in humans was first reported in 1980, and in
     the last five years the genetic basis for this polymorphism has been
     elucidated. Isolation and cloning of mutant alleles from humans with TPMT
     deficiency has identified the major mutant alleles, established the basis
     for loss of TPMT activity and permitted development of PCR-based
     genotyping assays to make a molecular diagnosis of TPMT-deficiency and
     heterozygosity. These studies illustrate the potential clinical benefits
     of elucidating the molecular basis of inherited differences in drug
     metabolism and disposition, and future automation of molecular diagnostics
     will make it feasible to more precisely select the optimal drug and dosage
     for individual patients.

     Caucasian and Asian populations.
PG  - 37-42
AB  - Thiopurine methyltransferase metabolizes 6-mercaptopurine, thioguanine and
     azathioprine, thereby regulating cytotoxicity and clinical response to
     these thiopurine drugs. In healthy Caucasian populations, 89-94% of
     individuals have high thiopurine methyltransferase activity, 6-11%
     intermediate and 0.3% low, resulting from genetic polymorphism. Four
     variant thiopurine methyltransferase alleles were detected in over 80% of
     individuals with low or intermediate thiopurine methyltransferase
     activity. The wild-type allele is defined as TPMT*1 and the mutant alleles
     are TPMT*2 (G238C), TPMT*3A (G460A and A719G), TPMT*3B (G460A) and TPMT*3B
     (A719G). The frequency of these alleles in different ethnic groups is not
     well defined. In this study, DNA from 199 British Caucasian, 99 British
     South West Asian and 192 Chinese individuals was analysed for the presence
     of these variant alleles using polymerase chain reaction-restriction
     fragment length polymorphism and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction
     based assays. The frequency of individuals with a variant thiopurine
     methyltransferase genotype was: Caucasians 10.1% (20/199), South West
     Asians 2.0% (2/99) and Chinese 4.7% (9/192). Two TPMT*2 heterozygotes were
     identified in the Caucasian population, but this allele was not found in
     the two Asian populations. TPMT*3A was the only mutant allele found in the
     South West Asians (two heterozygotes). This was also the most common
     mutant allele in the Caucasians (16 heterozygotes and one homozygote) but
     was not found in the Chinese. All mutant alleles identified in the Chinese
     population were TPMT*3C (nine heterozygotes). This allele was found at a
     low frequency in the Caucasians (one heterozygote). This suggests that
     A719G is the oldest mutation, with G460A being acquired later to form the
     TPMT*3A allele in the Caucasian and South West Asian populations. TPMT*2
     appears to be a more recent allele, which has only been detected in
     Caucasians to date. These ethnic differences may be important in the
     clinical use of thiopurine drugs.

AB  - Cancer chemotherapy is limited by significant inter-individual variations
     in responses and toxicities. Such variations are often due to genetic
     alterations in drug metabolising enzymes (pharmacokinetic polymorphisms)
     or receptor expression (pharmacodynamic polymorphisms). Pharmacogenetic
     screening prior to anticancer drug administration may lead to
     identification of specific populations predisposed to drug toxicity or
     poor drug responses. The role of polymorphisms in specific enzymes, such
     as thiopurine S-methyltransferases (TPMT), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase
     (DPD), aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH), glutathione S-transferases (GST),
     uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl-transferases (UGTs) and cytochrome P450
     (CYP 450) enzymes in cancer therapy are discussed in this review.

AB  - The level of expression of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)
     is an important determinant of the metabolism of thiopurines used in the
     treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia
     (AML). Studies in red blood cells (RBC) have shown that TPMT expression
     displays genetic polymorphism with 11% of individuals having intermediate
     and one in 300 undetectable levels. The genetic basis for this
     polymorphism has now been elucidated and polymerase chain reaction
     (PCR)-based assays described for the most common mutations accounting for
     reduced activity. In previous studies, genotype has been correlated with
     red blood cell activity. In this report, we describe the relationship
     between genotype and TPMT activity measured directly in the target of drug
     action, the leukemic cell. We have demonstrated that the TPMT activity in
     lymphoblasts from 38 children and adults found by PCR to be homozygotes
     (*1/*1) was significantly higher than that in the five heterozygotes
     (*1/*3) detected (median, 0.25 v 0.08, P < .002, Mann-Whitney U). Similar
     results were obtained when results from children were analyzed separately.
     However, comparison of activity in blasts from AML and ALL showed a higher
     level in the former (0.35 v 0.22 nU/mg, P < .002, n = 17, 35), suggesting
     that factors other than genotype may also influence expression.

AB  - This brief review discusses the relationship between genetic polymorphism
     of drug metabolizing enzyme and drug's safety and efficacy. When
     elimination occurs via a single metabolic pathway, individual differences
     in metabolic rates can lead to large differences in drug and metabolite
     concentrations in the blood. Genetic polymorphism leads to subpopulation
     of patients with decreased, absent or even increased activities of certain
     reactions (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, N-acetyltransferase, thiopurine
     methyltransferase polymorphism). The consequences of a genetic
     polymorphism include not only altered kinetics of specific drug substrate
     but idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions. Having these information will
     aid in determining dosage of certain medications to the patients with an
     inherited abnormality of drug metabolizing enzyme. Pharmacogenetics
     already has influenced therapeutics.

AB  - The formation of intracellular thionucleotides are a prerequisite for
     mercaptopurine (MP) cytotoxicity, and interindividual variations in the
     inherited level of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity regulate
     their formation. Measurement of pretreatment TPMT activities can identify
     the TPMT "deficient" patient and, conversely, the individual with very
     high enzyme activities. The former are at higher risk of acute toxicity
     and potentially fatal bone marrow failure and the latter of suboptimal
     treatment. Leukaemic children taking MP therapy who form inadequate
     amounts of thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) do not experience drug toxicity
     and are at an increased risk of disease relapse. When low TGNs are due to
     very high TPMT activities, thioguanine may be a more appropriate
     thiopurine. Another cause of inadequate TGN concentrations is partial or
     noncompliance with oral chemotherapy. Compliance problems can be
     identified by the measurement of both TGNs and methylated drug
     metabolites.

PG  - 15-22
AB  - Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is an important enzyme in the
     metabolism of 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), which is used in the treatment of
     acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). TPMT catalyzes the formation of
     methylthioinosine monophosphate (MetIMP), which is cytotoxic for cultured
     cell lines, and it plays a role in detoxification of 6MP. Population
     studies show a genetic polymorphism for TPMT with both high and low
     activity alleles. About 1 of 300 subjects is homozygous for the low
     activity. The function TPMT plays in detoxification or therapeutic
     efficacy of 6MP in vivo is not clear. In this article the genetic
     polymorphism of TPMT is reviewed and the contribution of TPMT to the
     cytotoxic action, or detoxification, of 6MP in children with ALL is
     discussed. Induction of TPMT activity has been described during the
     treatment for ALL. We performed a pilot study on the influence of
     high-dose 6MP infusions (1300 mg/m2 in 24 h) on TPMT activity of
     peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pMNC) of eleven patients with ALL. The
     TPMT activities were in, or, above the normal range. There was no
     statistically significant difference between the TPMT activities before
     and after the 6MP infusions. MetIMP levels in pMNC increased during
     successive courses. This might be explained by TPMT induction, but other
     explanations are plausible as well. Twenty five percent of the TPMT assays
     failed, because less than the necessary 5.10(6) pMNC could be isolated
     from the blood of leukopenic patients. Red blood cells can not be used for
     TPMT measurements, since transfusions are frequently required during the
     treatment with 6MP infusions. Therefore, the influence of high-dose 6MP
     infusions on TPMT activity can only be investigated further when a TPMT
     assay which requires less pMNC has been developed.

TI  - Polymorphic thiopurine methyltransferase in erythrocytes is indicative of
     activity in leukemic blasts from children with acute lymphoblastic
     leukemia.
PG  - 1897-902
AB  - The activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) exhibits genetic
     polymorphism, with approximately 1 in 300 individuals inheriting TPMT
     deficiency as an autosomal recessive trait, and about 11% having
     intermediate activity (ie, heterozygotes). Patients with TPMT deficiency
     accumulate excessive concentrations of 6-thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs)
     and develop severe toxicity when treated with standard dosages of
     mercaptopurine. High TPMT activity has been associated with lower
     concentrations of TGNs, yielding a higher risk of treatment failure in
     children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). As the biochemical basis
     of these pharmacodynamic relationships has not been fully elucidated, we
     investigated the variability and relationship of TPMT activity in
     erythrocytes and lymphoblasts from children with ALL. A 58-fold range of
     erythrocyte TPMT activity was found among 119 patients receiving ALL
     chemotherapy (0.6 to 34.9 U/mL packed erythrocytes), but relatively low
     intrapatient variability (coefficient of variation, 13.5%) was observed
     over 1 year. A 27-fold range in TPMT activity was observed in leukemic
     blasts obtained from 42 patients at initial diagnosis (3.3 to 88.9 U/1 x
     10(9) cells). TPMT activity in leukemic blasts at diagnosis was
     significantly correlated with TPMT in erythrocytes before therapy (rs =
     .75, P < .0001, N = 13). These data document extensive interpatient
     variability of TPMT activity in ALL blasts and establish its linkage to
     polymorphic TPMT activity in erythrocytes, providing a new mechanism by
     which erythrocytes serve as prognostic markers of mercaptopurine
     metabolism and TPMT activity in children with ALL.

     and a processed pseudogene on human chromosome 18q21.1.
PG  - 398-405
AB  - Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is a genetically polymorphic enzyme
     that catalyzes the S-methylation of thiopurine drugs such as
     6-mercaptopurine. This genetic polymorphism is an important factor
     responsible for individual variation in thiopurine drug response. A cDNA
     for TPMT has been cloned from T84 human colon carcinoma cells. Northern
     blot analysis of multiple human tissues was performed with the T84 human
     colon carcinoma TPMT cDNA open reading frame (ORF) as a probe as one step
     toward understanding the molecular basis for the TPMT genetic
     polymorphism. Three mRNA species (approximately 1.4, 2.0, and 3.6 kb in
     length) were present in all tissues studied, including liver. However,
     none of these mRNAs matched the length of the 2.7 kb T84 TPMT cDNA.
     Therefore, it was important to clone a TPMT cDNA from a human
     drug-metabolizing organ such as the liver to determine whether its
     sequence matched that of the cDNA cloned from the T84 cell line. A human
     liver cDNA library was screened with the T84 TPMT cDNA ORF as a probe, and
     a 1.8 kb cDNA was isolated with a coding region sequence identical to that
     of the T84 TPMT cDNA. The TPMT cDNA ORF was then used to screen a human
     lymphocytes genomic DNA library in an attempt to clone the TPMT gene(s) in
     humans. Three intronless clones were isolated with identical ORF sequences
     that were 96% identical to that of the TPMT cDNA, but which contained
     multiple nucleotide substitutions and one deletion. The 3'- and
     5'-flanking regions of one of the genomic DNA clones were
     sequenced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT; S-adenosyl-L-methionine:thiopurine
     S-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.67) activity exhibits genetic polymorphism,
     with approximately 0.33% of Caucasians and African-Americans inheriting
     TPMT deficiency as an autosomal recessive trait. To determine the
     molecular genetic basis for this polymorphism, we cloned the TPMT cDNA
     from a TPMT-deficient patient who had developed severe hematopoietic
     toxicity during mercaptopurine therapy. Northern blot analysis of RNA
     isolated from leukocytes of the deficient patient demonstrated the
     presence of TPMT mRNAs of comparable size to that in subjects with high
     TPMT activity. Sequencing of the mutant TPMT cDNA revealed a single point
     mutation (G238-->C), leading to an amino acid substitution at codon 80
     (Ala80-->Pro). When assessed in a yeast heterologous expression system,
     this mutation led to a 100-fold reduction in TPMT catalytic activity
     relative to the wild-type cDNA, despite a comparable level of mRNA
     expression. A mutation-specific PCR amplification method was developed and
     used to detect the G238-->C mutation in genomic DNA of the propositus and
     her mother. This inactivating mutation in the human TPMT gene provides
     insights into the genetic basis for this inherited polymorphism in drug
     metabolism.

TI  - The role of genetic variation in thiopurine methyltransferase activity and
     the efficacy and/or side effects of azathioprine therapy in dermatologic
     patients.
PG  - 193-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is one of three major
     enzymes involved in the metabolism of azathioprine and its active
     metabolite 6-mercaptopurine. Thiopurine methyltransferase activity is
     determined by an allelic polymorphism for either high (TPMTH) or low
     (TPMTL) enzyme activity. Homozygotes for the low activity allele are known
     to be at risk for profound myelosuppression with azathioprine.
     Heterozygotes may be at risk for myelosuppression. Homozygotes for the
     high activity allele may be inadequately immunosuppressed with
     conventional, empiric doses of azathioprine. We analyzed TPMT activity in
     red blood cell (RBC) lysates and determined the TPMT genotypes (based on
     normal population screening) of 28 dermatologic patients. This information
     was correlated with the observed efficacy and side effects of azathioprine
     therapy. OBSERVATIONS: Two patients with TPMT levels of less than 12.5
     U/mL RBCs (both TPMTH heterozygotes) experienced leukopenia (white blood
     count < 4.0 x 10(9)/L) with azathioprine doses around 1.5 mg/kg. A third
     patient who experienced leukopenia had a TPMT level at the lower end of
     the homozygous range (15.5 U/mL RBCs) but received the highest dose of
     azathioprine (2.6 mg/kg) of all patients in this series. Ten patients with
     TPMT levels of more than 18.5 U/mL RBCs (all TPMTH homozygotes) receiving
     less than 1.5 mg/kg of azathioprine were judged to have a poor clinical
     response. In comparison, seven patients with TPMT levels between 12.5 and
     18.5 U/mL RBCs (six TPMTH homozygotes and one TPMTH heterozygote)
     receiving 0.9 to 1.8 mg/kg of azathioprine had a favorable clinical
     response. Adverse effects of gastrointestinal upset and liver function
     test abnormalities did not appear to correlate with TPMT activity.
     CONCLUSION: The TPMTH heterozygotes may be at increased risk for
     myelosuppression with standard, empiric doses of azathioprine. On the
     other hand, homozygotes for TPMTH, particularly those with TPMT levels at
     the upper end of the homozygous range, may have a poor clinical response
     to azathioprine due to inadequate empiric dosing.
