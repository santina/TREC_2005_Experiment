TI  - IRAS is an anti-apoptotic protein.
PG  - 400-12
AB  - Active cell death, also known as apoptosis, has been implicated in the
     pathophysiology of diseases such as cancer, heart failure and
     neurodegenerative disorders. We report the anti-apoptotic function of
     IRAS, which was previously shown to bind imidazoline ligands. The amino
     acid sequence of human IRAS (hIRAS) is unrelated to known proteins, except
     for rat IRAS and a mouse homologue named nischarin, which binds the alpha5
     integrin subunit of the fibronectin receptor. When stably transfected into
     PC12 cells, hIRAS localizes to the cytosol as a 167 kDa immunoreactive
     protein. Clonal PC12 cell lines expressing hIRAS displayed normal serum
     growth responses. However, hIRAS expression led to prolonged cell survival
     against known apoptotic stimuli: serum starvation or thapsigargin or
     staurosporine treatments. The apoptotic population of hIRAS-expressing
     cells was significantly reduced, and this protection was achieved by a
     decrease in caspase-3 activity, phosphatidylserine translocation, and
     nuclear fragmentation. Similar protective effect was obtained in COS7
     cells transiently transfected with hIRAS. A partial activation of the PI3
     kinase pathway is possibly implicated in the anti-apoptotic effect of
     IRAS. Thus, IRAS appears to represent a previously unknown anti-apoptotic
     protein involved in the regulation of cell survival.

     TSU-Pr1 human bladder cancer cells.
PG  - 4765-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has strong chemoprotective
     properties in experimental animal models. The insulin-like growth factor
     (IGF) system has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of
     bladder cancer. The present study examined CLA regulation of TSU-Pr1
     bladder cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis and the influence of CLA
     on IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TSU-Pr1 cells
     were cultured in serum-free medium with 0, 2, 5, or 10 microM CLA and/or
     10 nM IGF-I. [3H]Thymidne incorporation, DNA laddering, FACS analysis,
     immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed. RESULTS: CLA
     decreased DNA synthesis and induced apoptosis in TSU-Pr1 cells
     dose-dependently. Exogenous IGF-I alone increased viable cell numbers but
     did not counteract growth inhibition induced by CLA. CLA decreased IGF-IR
     and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 protein levels. In addition, CLA
     decreased IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR and IRS-1, recruitment
     of the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase to IRS-1 and
     phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2.
     CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CLA inhibits cell proliferation and
     stimulates apoptosis of TSU-Pr1 cells via its inhibition of the IGF-IR
     signaling pathway.

PG  - 843-9
AB  - The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) is a promising
     anticancer treatment target, being frequently overexpressed by tumours,
     and mediating proliferation, motility and apoptosis protection. Design of
     specific kinase inhibitors is problematic because of homology between the
     IGF1R and insulin receptor. This obstacle can be circumvented using
     sequence-specific molecular agents including antisense, triplex and
     ribozymes. Recent studies indicate that profound sequence-specific IGF1R
     gene silencing can be induced by small interfering RNAs that mediate RNA
     interference in mammalian cells. IGF1R downregulation blocks tumour growth
     and metastasis, and enhances sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs and
     irradiation. In murine melanoma cells, radiosensitisation is associated
     with impaired activation of Atm, which is required for initiation of cell
     cycle checkpoints and DNA repair pathways after double-strand DNA breaks.
     Furthermore, tumour cells killed in vivo following IGF1R downregulation
     can provoke an immune response, protecting against tumour rechallenge.
     After years of studying the role of the IGF system in tumour biology,
     novel agents for IGF1R targeting will soon be available for clinical
     testing. This review summarises the development of molecular agents, and
     considers factors that will influence clinical activity, including the
     requirement of established tumours for IGF signalling, and the efficacy
     and toxicity of IGF1R inhibitors.

     receptor in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
PG  - 293-303
AB  - The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is expressed in many
     cell types and is critical for normal growth and development. In the
     healthy mammary gland, the role of IGF-IR is not fully elucidated.
     However, IGF-IR, which is primarily expressed in the mammary epithelial
     cells, is known to play an obligatory role in cellular transformation,
     facilitating the progression to breast cancer. We have utilized the
     tetracycline regulatory (tet-on) system to generate an in vitro model
     system to allow us to further investigate IGF-I/IGF-IR function in mammary
     epithelial cells. A plasmid construct containing a mutant IGF-I receptor
     (IGF-IR-DN) fused to the tetracycline operator (tetOPh(CMV)-IGF-IR-DN) was
     stably transfected into MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The conditional
     regulation of the IGF-IR-DN gene expression was studied in four
     independent clonal lines. The translated IGF-IR-DN protein was detected
     only in the stably transfected doxycycline- induced cells, and its
     expression was up-regulated (three- to sixfold) following induction. IGF-I
     stimulated cell proliferation diminished (twofold) in doxycycline- induced
     cells compared to uninduced cells, demonstrating that the transgene
     construct was functional and ruling out any pleiotropic effect that may be
     attributed to doxycycline. Interestingly, autophosphorylation of the
     IGF-IR and phosphorylation of the downstream substrate, insulin receptor
     substrate-1 (IRS-1), was not inhibited in doxycycline/IGF-I treated cells,
     suggesting the possibility that activation of downstream substrates other
     than the IRS-1 may be critical for optimal cell proliferation. This novel
     in vitro model should allow us to more directly examine the role of
     IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling and function in mammary epithelial cells.

TI  - A fully human monoclonal antibody to the insulin-like growth factor I
     receptor blocks ligand-dependent signaling and inhibits human tumor growth
     in vivo.
PG  - 8912-21
AB  - The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is overexpressed in
     many diverse tumor types and is a critical signaling molecule for tumor
     cell proliferation and survival. Therapeutic strategies targeting the
     IGF-IR may therefore be effective broad-spectrum anticancer agents.
     Through screening of a Fab phage display library, we have generated a
     fully human antibody (A12) that binds to the IGF-IR with high affinity
     (4.11 x 10(-11) M) and inhibits ligand binding with an IC(50) of 0.6-1 nM.
     Antibody-mediated blockade of ligand binding to the IGF-IR inhibited
     downstream signaling of the two major insulin-like growth factor (IGF)
     pathways, mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol
     3'-kinase/Akt, in MCF7 human breast cancer cells. As a result, the
     mitogenic and proliferative potential of IGF-I and IGF-II were
     significantly reduced. A12 did not block insulin binding to the insulin
     receptor but could block binding to atypical IGF-IR in MCF7 cells. In
     addition, A12 was shown to induce IGF-IR internalization and degradation
     on specific binding to tumor cells, resulting in a significant reduction
     in cell surface receptor density. In xenograft tumor models in vivo,
     IGF-IR blockade by A12 was shown to occur rapidly, resulting in
     significant growth inhibition of breast, renal, and pancreatic tumors.
     Histological analysis of tumor sections demonstrated a marked increase in
     apoptotic tumor cells in antibody-treated animals. These results
     demonstrate that A12 possesses strong antitumor activity in vitro and in
     vivo and may therefore be an effective therapeutic candidate for the
     treatment of cancers that are dependent on IGF-IR signaling for growth and
     survival.

PG  - 1606-11
AB  - Insulin is a mild mitogen and has been shown to potentiate mitogenic
     influence of other growth factors. Because hyperinsulinemia and/or
     overexpression of insulin receptors have been linked to development,
     progression, and outcome of breast cancer, we attempted to evaluate the
     mechanism of these associations. We have compared the expression of
     insulin receptors and the magnitude of insulin signaling in breast tumors
     and adjacent normal mammary tissue samples obtained from 20 patients. We
     observed that insulin binding more than doubled in the tumors as compared
     with the normal tissue (P <.01 by paired t test). Insulin signaling to
     Shc, judged by the magnitude of its phosphorylation, was also
     significantly enhanced in the tumors. In contrast, the phosphorylation of
     the insulin-receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), Akt, and mitogen-activated
     protein (MAP) kinase were identical in the tumorous and normal mammary
     tissues. Finally, tumors displayed significantly increased amounts of
     farnesylated p21 Ras and geranylgeranylated Rho-A (P <.01), consistent
     with Shc-dependent activation of farnesyl (FTase) and geranylgeranyl
     transferases (GGTase) in the tumor tissue. We conclude that the mechanism
     of the mitogenic influence of insulin in breast cancer may include
     increased expression of insulin receptors, preferential
     hyperphosphorylation of Shc, and increased amounts of prenylated p21 Ras
     and Rho-A in tumor tissue as compared with adjacent normal mammary tissue.

TI  - A highly conserved NTRK3 C-terminal sequence in the ETV6-NTRK3 oncoprotein
     binds the phosphotyrosine binding domain of insulin receptor substrate-1:
     an essential interaction for transformation.
PG  - 6225-34
AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases are integral components of cellular signaling
     pathways and are frequently deregulated in malignancies. The NTRK family
     of neurotrophin receptors mediate neuronal cell survival and
     differentiation, but altered NTRK signaling has also been implicated in
     oncogenesis. The ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) gene fusion occurs in human pediatric
     spindle cell sarcomas and secretory breast carcinoma, and encodes the
     oligomerization domain of the ETV6 transcription factor fused to the
     protein-tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3. The EN protein functions as a
     constitutively active protein-tyrosine kinase with potent transforming
     activity in multiple cell lineages, and EN constitutively activates both
     the Ras-MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathways. EN
     transformation is associated with constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of
     insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Further, IRS-1 functions as the
     adaptor protein linking EN to downstream signaling pathways. However, the
     exact nature of the EN-IRS-1 interaction remains unknown. We now
     demonstrate that EN specifically binds the phosphotyrosine binding domain
     of IRS-1 via an interaction at the C terminus of EN. An EN mutant lacking
     the C-terminal 19 amino acids does not bind IRS-1 and lacks transforming
     ability. Moreover, expression of an IRS-1 polypeptide containing the
     phosphotyrosine binding domain acts in a dominant negative manner to
     inhibit EN transformation, and overexpression of IRS-1 potentiates EN
     transforming activity. These findings indicate that EN.IRS-1 complex
     formation through the NTRK3 C terminus is essential for EN transformation.

     factor 1 receptor correlates with enhanced apoptosis and dedifferentiation
     in human neuroblastomas.
PG  - 5683-92
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the expression of the insulin receptor-related
     receptor (IRR) in primary human neuroblastomas with other biological and
     clinical parameters and the impact of its expression on prognostic
     outcome. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied 49 neuroblastomas of different
     clinical stages and histological subtypes for (a) IRR, insulin-like growth
     factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), TrkA, p75 neurotrophin receptor, and MYCN mRNA
     expression by reverse transcription-PCR; (b) MYCN gene amplification by
     Southern blot analyses; (c) cyclin A protein expression by Western blot
     analyses indicating proliferation rate; and (d) apoptotic index (AI) by
     terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Tdt)-mediated dUTP nick
     end-labeling assay. RESULTS: IRR mRNA expression was found in 25 (51%)
     neuroblastomas and correlated with stages 1, 2, 3, and 4S disease and with
     age </=12 months at diagnosis. IRR was expressed predominantly in
     neuroblastomas without MYCN gene amplification and coexpressed with
     IGF-1R, TrkA, and p75 neurotrophin receptor. IRR mRNA expression also
     correlated with an undifferentiated histology but not with the
     proliferation rate. In coexpression with IGF-1R, the IRR was associated
     with enhanced AI. IRR expression was significantly correlated with a good
     prognosis in all 49 neuroblastomas (6-year survival probability, 91.8%
     versus 49.7% for IRR nonexpression; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: IRR expression
     is a new marker for a favorable prognosis in neuroblastoma that is
     independent of MYCN amplification and age at diagnosis. Our data suggest
     an influence of IRR on IGF signaling via IGF-1R because coexpression of
     these two receptor tyrosine kinases was significantly correlated with an
     undifferentiated histology, a high AI, and an advanced survival
     probability.

PG  - 431-9
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Interferons are pleiotropic cytokines that exhibit
     important biologic activities, including antiviral, antitumor, and
     immunomodulatory effects. These cytokines have found important
     applications in clinical medicine, including the treatment of certain
     malignancies. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on basic
     and clinical research in the interferon field. RECENT FINDINGS:
     Significant advances have recently occurred in the field of type I
     interferon signal transduction. It is well known that the interferons
     transduce signals via activation of multiple signaling cascades, involving
     Jak kinases, signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins,
     Map kinases, and IRS and Crk proteins. Recent evidence indicates that the
     p38 Map kinase pathway plays an important role in type I interferon
     signaling in malignant cells and that its function is required for type I
     interferon-dependent gene transcription and generation of the
     antiproliferative of type I interferons. In clinical oncology,
     interferon-alpha remains an active and useful agent in the treatment of
     several malignant disorders, and efforts are underway to improve its
     efficacy by using different schedules and combinations with other agents.
     SUMMARY: This review summarizes the mechanisms of signal transduction of
     interferons and the emerging new concepts in this area. An update on the
     clinical applications of interferons in oncology is also provided, and
     potential translational applications, reflecting recent advances in the
     field, are discussed.

TI  - A dominant negative type I insulin-like growth factor receptor inhibits
     metastasis of human cancer cells.
PG  - 5017-24
AB  - We have previously shown that LCC6 wild-type (WT) cells, a metastatic
     variant of MDA-MB-435 cancer cells originally derived from a breast cancer
     patient, exhibit enhanced motility in response to IGF-I compared with the
     parent MDA-MB-435 cells. To further understand the role of the type I
     insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor (IGF1R) in cancer metastasis we
     inhibited signaling via IGF1R using a C-terminal-truncated IGF1R. The
     truncated receptor retains the ligand binding domain but lacks the
     autophosphorylated tyrosine residues in the carboxyl terminus. Cells
     stably transfected with this truncated receptor (LCC6-DN cells)
     overexpressed the truncated IGF1R messenger RNA nearly 50-fold over
     endogenous receptor. The truncated receptor in the LCC6-DN cells behaved
     in a dominant negative manner to inhibit endogenous IGF1R activation by
     IGF-I. Compared with the LCC6-WT cells, LCC6-DN cells failed to
     phosphorylate the adaptor proteins insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 in
     response to IGF-I and did not activate Akt after exposure to IGF-I. Unlike
     LCC6-WT cells, LCC6-DN cells did not show enhanced motility in response to
     IGF-I. To assay for metastasis, LCC6-WT and LCC6-DN cells were injected
     into the mammary fat pads of mice, and the primary xenograft tumors were
     removed after 21 days. Mice sacrificed 5 weeks later showed multiple lung
     metastases derived from LCC-WT xenografts, whereas mice harboring LCC6-DN
     xenografts showed no lung metastases. Our data show that IGF1R can
     regulate several aspects of the malignant phenotype. In these cells,
     metastasis but not proliferation requires IGF1R function.

     permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor expression in
     pancreatic cancer cells.
PG  - 3941-8
AB  - Vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor
     (VPF/VEGF), the critical molecule in tumor angiogenesis, is regulated by
     different stimuli, such as hypoxia and oncogenes, and also by growth
     factors. Previously we have shown that in AsPC-1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma
     cells, insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) regulates VPF/VEGF
     expression. Insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2), two
     major downstream molecules of IGF-1R, are known to be important in the
     genesis of diabetes. In this study, we have defined a new role of IRS in
     angiogenesis. Both of the IRS proteins modulate VPF/VEGF expression in
     pancreatic cancer cells by different mechanistic pathways. The
     Sp1-dependent VPF/VEGF transcription is regulated mainly by IRS-2. Protein
     kinase C-zeta (PKC-zeta) plays a central role in VPF/VEGF expression and
     acts as a switching element. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that
     the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, but not the Ras pathway, is a
     downstream event of IRS proteins for VPF/VEGF expression in AsPC-1 cells.
     Interestingly, like renal cancer cells, in AsPC-1 cells PKC-zeta leads to
     direct Sp1-dependent VPF/VEGF transcription; in addition, it also promotes
     a negative feedback loop to IRS-2 that decreases the association of
     IRS-2/IGF-1R and IRS-2/p85. Taken together, our results show that in
     AsPC-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells, Sp1-dependent VPF/VEGF transcription is
     controlled by IGF-1R signaling through IRS-2 proteins and modulated by a
     negative feedback loop of PKC-zeta to IRS-2. Our data also suggest that
     IRS proteins, which are known to play crucial roles in IGF-1R signaling,
     are also important mediators for tumor angiogenesis.

TI  - Insulin down-regulates insulin receptor substrate-2 expression through the
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.
PG  - 253-66
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 are the major substrates that
     mediate insulin action. Insulin itself regulates the expression of the IRS
     protein in the liver, but the underlying mechanisms of IRS-1 and IRS-2
     regulation are not fully understood. Here we report that insulin
     suppressed the expression of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins in Fao hepatoma
     cells. The decrease in IRS-1 protein occurred via proteasomal degradation
     without any change in IRS-1 mRNA, whereas the insulin-induced suppression
     of IRS-2 protein was associated with a parallel decrease in IRS-2 mRNA
     without changing IRS-2 mRNA half-life. The insulin-induced suppression of
     IRS-2 mRNA and protein was blocked by the phosphatidylinositol (PI)
     3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, but not by the MAP kinase-ERK kinase (MEK)
     inhibitor, PD098059. Inhibition of Akt by overexpression of
     dominant-negative Akt also caused complete attenuation of the
     insulin-induced decrease in IRS-2 protein and partial attenuation of its
     mRNA down-regulation. Some nuclear proteins bound to the insulin response
     element (IRE) sequence on the IRS-2 gene in an insulin-dependent manner in
     vitro, and the binding was also blocked by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor.
     Reporter gene assay showed that insulin suppressed the activity of both
     human and rat IRS-2 gene promoters through the IRE in a PI
     3-kinase-dependent manner. Our results indicate that insulin regulates
     IRS-1 and IRS-2 through different mechanisms and that insulin represses
     IRS-2 gene expression via a PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway.

TI  - Selective ovary resistance to insulin signaling in women with polycystic
     ovary syndrome.
PG  - 954-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Insulin resistance is a common feature of both polycystic ovary
     syndrome (PCOS) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM);
     however, the persistent reproductive disturbances appear to be limited to
     the former, suggesting that insulin resistance in the ovary itself may
     confer this susceptibility. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING:
     University-affiliated department. PATIENT(S): Forty-four women undergoing
     IVF treatment, of whom 11 had polycystic ovaries and 33 had normal
     ovulation (NO). INTERVENTION(S): The various effects and signaling of
     insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were examined in cultured
     ovarian granulosa cells treated with troglitazone (1 microg/mL) or with
     vehicle by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot,
     and in vitro functional analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Glycogen and
     DNA syntheses, mRNA and protein expression, and cellular localization of
     insulin/IGF-1 receptors and insulin receptor substrates (IRSs). RESULT(S):
     There were significant decreases in insulin-stimulated glucose
     incorporation into glycogen in PCOS cells, which is a metabolic action of
     insulin. However, IGF-1 stimulation was found to be greater in PCOS cells
     at all experimental concentrations with respect to thymidine incorporation
     compared with NO cells, which is a mitogenic action. Troglitazone
     increased the insulin-induced glycogen synthesis but reduced the
     IGF-1-augmented responses of DNA synthesis in PCOS cells to the range
     within those of NO granulosa cells. We then found that troglitazone
     treatment reversed the expression imbalance between IRS-1 and IRS-2 in
     PCOS cells. CONCLUSION(S): There is a selective defect in insulin actions
     in PCOS granulosa cells, which suggests ovarian insulin resistance, and
     this metabolic phenotype is associated with an enhanced IGF-1 mitogenic
     potential. Troglitazone could divergently alter expression of various IRS
     molecules and insulin actions and could be used as an ovarian insulin
     sensitizer and mitogen/steroidogenic inhibitor in PCOS.

TI  - Progesterone crosstalks with insulin-like growth factor signaling in
     breast cancer cells via induction of insulin receptor substrate-2.
PG  - 6937-41
AB  - Both progesterone and the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are
     critically involved in mammary gland development and also in breast cancer
     progression. However, how the progesterone and IGF signaling pathways
     interact with each other to regulate breast cancer cell growth remains
     unresolved. In this study, we investigated progesterone regulation of IGF
     signaling components in breast cancer cells. We found that insulin
     receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) levels were markedly induced by progesterone
     and the synthetic progestin R5020 in MCF-7 and other progesterone receptor
     (PR) positive breast cancer cell lines, whereas IRS-1 and the IGF-I
     receptor were not induced. The antiprogestin RU486 blocked the R5020
     effect on IRS-2 expression. Ectopic expression of either PR-A or PR-B in
     C4-12 breast cancer cells (estrogen receptor and PR negative) showed that
     progestin upregulation of IRS-2 was mediated specifically by PR-B. The
     IRS-2 induction by R5020 occurred via an increase of IRS-2 mRNA levels.
     Furthermore, progestin treatment prior to IGF-I stimulation resulted in
     higher tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-2 levels, increased binding of IRS-2 to
     Grb-2 and the PI3K regulatory subunit p85, and correspondingly enhanced
     ERK and Akt activation, as compared with IGF-I-only conditions. Taken
     together, our data suggest that IRS-2 may play an important role in
     crosstalk between progesterone and the IGFs in breast cancer cells.

PG  - 365-70
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is now recognized as an important
     metabolic and reproductive disorder. It is associated with substantial
     defects in insulin action and secretion that confer a markedly increased
     risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance modifies
     reproductive function both by the direct actions of insulin on
     steroidogenesis and by disruption of insulin signaling pathways in the
     central nervous system. These insights have led to a new therapy for PCOS
     with insulin-sensitizing agents. Hyperandrogenemia and insulin resistance
     cluster in PCOS families, consistent with a genetic susceptibility to
     these abnormalities. There is evidence for both linkage and association of
     the hyperandrogenemia phenotype with an allele of a marker locus on
     chromosome 19, in the region of the gene encoding the insulin receptor.

TI  - Insulin augmentation of 17alpha-hydroxylase activity is mediated by

     kinase-1/2 in human ovarian theca cells.
PG  - 175-83
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome, characterized by hyperandrogenism and chronic
     anovulation, is frequently associated with insulin resistance. Ample
     evidence implicates a role for insulin in the genesis of ovarian
     hyperandrogenism. The objective of this study was to begin to define the
     intracellular signaling pathway(s) that mediates insulin regulation of
     17alpha-hydroxylase activity in human ovarian theca cells. Third-passage
     theca cells, isolated from the ovaries of regularly cycling premenopausal
     women, were used. Insulin alone had no effect on 17alpha-hydroxylase
     activity or CYP17 mRNA expression but required costimulation with
     forskolin. At the insulin concentration used (10 ng/ml), a neutralizing
     antibody to the insulin receptor (but not an antibody to the type I IGF
     receptor) blocked the insulin stimulation of 17alpha-hydroxylase activity,
     demonstrating that the effects were mediated by the insulin receptor.
     Insulin stimulated both phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and
     extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (MAPK) pathways. Specific
     inhibition of MAPK kinase (MEK) with PD98059 or I0126 did not decrease the
     17alpha-hydroxylase activity stimulated by forskolin or forskolin plus
     insulin. In contrast, the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 completely blocked
     insulin-stimulated 17alpha-hydroxylase activity. Our data demonstrate that
     insulin stimulates PI3-kinase and extracellular signal-regulated
     kinase-1/2 activities in human theca cells, but only PI3-kinase mediates
     the insulin augmentation of forskolin-stimulated 17alpha-hydroxylase
     activity.

TI  - The functions of insulin signaling: size isn't everything, even in
     Drosophila.
PG  - 375-97
AB  - Mammalian insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) signal through
     several receptors with different ligand specificities to regulate
     metabolism and growth. This regulation is defective in diabetes and in a
     wide variety of human tumors. Recent analysis in Drosophila melanogaster
     has revealed that insulin-like molecules (known as DILPs in flies) also
     control growth and metabolism, but probably do so by signaling through a
     single insulin receptor (InR). The intracellular signaling molecules
     regulated by this receptor are highly evolutionarily conserved. Work in
     flies has helped to dissect the network of InR-regulated intracellular
     signaling pathways and identify some of the critical players in these
     pathways and in interacting signaling cascades. Surprisingly, these
     studies have shown that DILPs control tissue and body growth primarily by
     regulating cell growth and cell size. Changes in cell growth produced by
     these molecules may subsequently modulate the rate of cell proliferation
     in a cell type-specific fashion. At least part of this growth effect is
     mediated by two small groups of neurons in the Drosophila brain, which
     secrete DILPs into the circulatory system at levels that are modulated by
     nutrition. This signaling center is also involved in DILP-dependent
     control of the fly's rate of development, fertility, and life span. These
     surprisingly diverse functions of InR signaling, which appear to be
     conserved in all higher animals, reflect a central role for this pathway
     in coordinating development, physiology, and properly proportioned growth
     of the organism in response to its nutritional state. Studies in flies are
     providing important new insights into the biology of this system, and the
     identification of novel components in the InR-regulated signaling cascade
     is already beginning to inform the development of new therapeutic
     strategies for insulin-linked diseases in the clinic.

     melanoma cells modulate insulin receptor-regulated signal transduction and
     augment [correction of augments] resistance to apoptosis.
PG  - 2945-52
AB  - In a variety of malignancies, the immune-escape phenotype is associated,
     in part, with the inability of tumor cells to properly present their Ags
     to CTLs due to a deranged expression of MHC class I glycoproteins.
     However, these molecules were found to possess broader nonimmune
     functions, including participation in signal transduction and regulation
     of proliferation, differentiation, and sensitivity to apoptosis-inducing
     factors; processes, which are characteristically impaired during malignant
     transformation. We investigated whether the deranged expression of MHC
     class I expression by tumor cells could affect proper receptor-mediated
     signal transduction and accentuate their malignant phenotype. The
     malignant and H-2K murine MHC class I-deficient B16BL6 melanoma cells were
     characterized by an attenuated capacity to bind insulin due to the
     retention of corresponding receptor in intracellular stores. The
     restoration of H-2K expression in these cells, which abrogated their
     capacity to form tumors in mice, enhanced membrane translocation of the
     receptor, presumably, by modulating its glycosylation. The addition of
     insulin to H-2K-expressing melanoma cells cultured in serum-free
     conditions precluded apoptotic death by up-regulating the activity of
     protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt. In contrast, the deficiency for H-2K
     characteristic to the malignant clones was associated with a constitutive
     high activity of PKB/Akt, which rendered them resistant to apoptosis,
     induced by deprivation of serum-derived growth factors. The possibility to
     correct the regulation of PKB/Akt activity by restoration of H-2K
     expression in B16BL6 melanoma cells may be considered as an attractive
     approach for cancer therapy, since an aberrant activation of this enzyme
     is characteristic to resistant malignancies.

TI  - Growth factor-specific regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1
     expression in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells: effects on the insulin-like
     growth factor signaling pathway.
PG  - 4811-9
AB  - IGFs are potent mitogens that play a crucial role in cell proliferation
     and/or differentiation and tumorigenesis. Insulin receptor substrate-1
     (IRS-1) is a key protein in the IGF signaling pathway in the
     estrogen-dependent MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line. In this study, three
     growth factors [fibroblast growth factor (FGF), epidermal growth factor
     (EGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)] were tested for their
     ability to modulate IRS-1 protein expression and the IGF-I signaling
     pathway. FGF and, to a lesser extent, EGF were found to increase IRS-1
     protein, whereas PDGF had no effect. This indicates that growth factors
     can specifically modulate IRS-1 protein content. The increases provoked by
     EGF and FGF were dependent on the MAPK signaling pathway but independent
     of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) signaling and required de
     novo protein synthesis. We noted that the kinetics of MAPK activation was
     continuous in response to FGF but transient in response to EGF. In
     addition, transfection of cells with a constitutively active form of MAPK
     kinase, which results in continuous MAPK activity, increased IRS-1
     expression. Taken together, these results suggest that stimulation of
     IRS-1 expression was therefore stronger when MAPK activity was sustained.
     Pretreatment of cells with EGF, FGF, or PDGF for 24 h reduced
     IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation per molecule of IRS-1. However,
     IGF-I-induced PI 3-kinase activity was decreased by 24 h of pretreatment
     with EGF or PDGF but not with FGF. Our results therefore demonstrate that
     different growth factors are capable of specifically modulating the IGF-I
     signaling via IRS-1. They further suggest that the FGF-induced increase in
     IRS-1 counterbalances the inhibition of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation to
     allow normal stimulation of IGF-I-induced PI 3-kinase activity.

TI  - C-peptide enhances insulin-mediated cell growth and protection against
     high glucose-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells.
PG  - 375-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that C-peptide exerts preventive
     and therapeutic effects on diabetic neuropathy in type 1 diabetic
     BB/Wor-rats and that it prevents duration-dependent hippocampal apoptosis
     in the same animal model. In the present study, we examined human
     neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to examine whether C-peptide stimulates cell
     proliferation/neurite outgrowth and whether it has antiapoptotic effects.
     METHODS: For neurite outgrowth, serum-starved cultures were treated with
     C-peptide and/or insulin or IGF-1. Neurites were visualized with NF-L
     antibody and measured morphometrically. Cell numbers were determined using
     an electronic cell counter. Scrambled C-peptide was used as a negative
     control. For assessment of apoptosis, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with
     100 mM glucose for 24 h, and the effects of C-peptide and/or insulin or
     IGF-1 were examined. Apoptosis was demonstrated by transferase-mediated
     dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)/4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
     stainings, flow cytometry and changes in the expression of Bcl2.
     Activation of insulin signaling intermediaries was determined by Western
     blots. Translocation of NF-kappaB was demonstrated immunocytochemically.
     RESULTS: C-peptide but not scrambled C-peptide stimulated cell
     proliferation and neurite outgrowth. In the presence of 4 nM insulin, 3 nM
     C-peptide significantly increased autophosphorylation of the insulin
     receptor (IR) but not that of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor
     (IGF-1R). It stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase) and p38
     mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, enhanced the expression
     and translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), promoted the
     expression of Bcl2 and reduced c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
     phosphorylation in excess of that of insulin alone. CONCLUSIONS: C-peptide
     in the presence of insulin exerts synergistic effects on cell
     proliferation, neurite outgrowth and has in the presence of insulin an
     antiapoptotic effect on high glucose-induced apoptosis but less so on
     hyperosmolar-induced apoptosis. These effects are likely to be mediated
     via interactions with the insulin signaling pathway.

TI  - An anti-insulin-like growth factor I receptor antibody that is a potent
     inhibitor of cancer cell proliferation.
PG  - 5073-83
AB  - An antagonistic monoclonal antibody, designated EM164, has been developed
     which binds specifically to the human insulin-like growth factor I
     receptor (IGF-IR) and inhibits the proliferation and survival functions of
     the receptor in cancer cells. EM164 was initially selected by a rapid
     cell-based screen of hybridoma supernatants to identify antibodies that
     bind to IGF-IR but not to the homologous insulin receptor and that show
     maximal inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated autophosphorylation of IGF-IR.
     EM164 binds tightly to IGF-IR with a dissociation constant K(d) of 0.1 nM,
     inhibits binding of IGF-I and antagonizes its effects on cells completely,
     and has no agonistic activity on its own. EM164 inhibits IGF-I-, IGF-II-,
     and serum-stimulated proliferation and survival of diverse human cancer
     cell lines in vitro, including breast, lung, colon, cervical, ovarian,
     pancreatic, melanoma, prostate, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and
     osteosarcoma cancer lines. It also suppresses the autocrine or paracrine
     proliferation of several cancer cell lines. EM164 was the most potent
     antagonistic anti-IGF-IR antibody tested when compared with several
     commercially available antibodies. The in vitro inhibitory effect could be
     extended to in vivo tumor models, where EM164 caused regression of
     established BxPC-3 human pancreatic tumor xenografts in SCID mice. The
     antitumor effect of treatment with EM164 could be enhanced by combining it
     with the cytotoxic agent gemcitabine. These data support the development
     of EM164 as a candidate therapeutic agent that targets IGF-IR function in
     cancer cells.

PG  - 170-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the insulin receptor (IR) mRNA
     levels and IR tyrosine kinase activity in normal myometrium and leiomyoma.
     DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: Academic research center. PATIENTS:
     Five women with leiomyoma submitted to hysterectomy. INTERVENTION: Plasma
     membrane fraction of human myometrium and leiomyoma were prepared and
     samples were incubated with and without insulin. mRNA was isolated and
     RT-PCR with specific primers was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Western
     blots of plasma membranes incubated with and without insulin were
     performed. Chemoluminescent methods followed by densitometry were used to
     assess IR autophosphorylation. RT-PCR with specific primers for IR gene
     sequences was used to determine IR mRNA levels. RESULTS: IR mRNA levels in
     myometrium (0.634+/-0.038) and in leiomyoma (0.649+/-0.047; p=0.813) were
     not different. The degree of insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation
     (relative optical density of the 95 kDa band) was also not different
     between myometrium (1.496+/-0.310) and leiomyoma (1.593+/-0.129; p=0.650).
     CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in IR receptor expression and IR
     autophosphorylation between normal myometrium and leiomyoma. Other steps
     of insulin signaling chain may participate in the altered proliferation of
     leiomyomas.

TI  - T-antigen of human polyomavirus JC cooperates withIGF-IR signaling system
     in cerebellar tumors of the childhood-medulloblastomas.
PG  - 2035-41
AB  - Polyomaviruses are implicated in a number of cancers, and the transforming
     activity of their early protein, large T-antigen, has been documented in a
     variety of cell types and in experimental animals (1). Although the
     pathways by which T-antigen induces uncontrolled cell growth are not fully
     defined, T-antigen mediated inactivation of tumor suppressors, p53 and
     pRB, is well-documented in some malignancies (2). Here we postulate that
     functional interaction between the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-IR) and
     the T-antigen of human polyomavirus JC (JCV T-antigen) may contribute to
     the process of malignant transformation in medulloblastomas: (i) the
     IGF-IR signaling system is strongly activated in medulloblastoma cell
     lines and medulloblastoma biopsies; (ii) the cytoplasmic protein, insulin
     receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), is translocated to the nucleus in the
     presence of JCV T-antigen; (iii) molecular characterization of the
     interaction between IRS-1 and JCV T-antigen indicates that the binding
     involves the N-terminal portion of IRS-1 (PH/PTB domain) and the
     C-terminal region of JCV T-antigen (aa 411-628); and finally (iv)
     competition for the IRS-1-JCV T-antigen binding attenuates
     anchorage-independent growth of T-antigen positive medulloblastoma cells
     in culture. Based on these findings, we propose a novel role for IRS-1 in
     JCV T-antigen-mediated deregulation of cellular equilibrium, which may
     involve uncoupling of IRS-1 from the surface receptor and translocation of
     its function to the nuclear compartment of the cell.

     hepatoma cell line.
PG  - 115-20
AB  - Leptin, the 16 kDa protein product of the ob gene, is secreted by
     adipocytes. The long form leptin receptor (ObRb) is expressed at high
     levels in the hypothalamus, and regulates appetite and energy expenditure.
     The fact that serum concentration of leptin is correlated with body mass
     index (BMI) suggests reduced sensitivity to leptin. Even though
     hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia could coexist in obese humans, little
     is known about the interaction of insulin and leptin. In this study, we
     examined the effect of insulin on leptin signaling using Huh 7 cells
     transiently transfected with ObRb cDNA. Insulin inhibits leptin-induced
     STAT3 phosphorylation in a time- and dose-dependent manner without
     affecting Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) JAK2 phosphorylation. Okadaic acid
     prevents the inhibitory effect of insulin on leptin-induced STAT3
     activation.

TI  - Conjugated linoleic acid downregulates insulin-like growth factor-I
     receptor levels in HT-29 human colon cancer cells.
PG  - 2675-81
AB  - Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has chemoprotective properties in a variety
     of experimental cancer models. We have previously observed that dietary
     CLA inhibits colon tumorigenesis induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in rats.
     In addition, our in vitro studies have shown that CLA inhibits DNA
     synthesis and induces apoptosis in HT-29 cells, the human colon
     adenocarcinoma cell line. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system
     regulates the growth of HT-29 cells by an autocrine mechanism. The present
     study examined whether the growth inhibitory effect of CLA is related to
     changes in the IGF system in HT-29 cells. To determine whether CLA
     inhibits IGF-II production, HT-29 cells were incubated in serum-free
     medium in the presence of various concentrations of CLA. CLA decreased
     protein levels of both mature and pro IGF-II and IGF-II transcripts.
     Whereas exogenous IGF-I and IGF-II produced an increase in cell number,
     neither IGF-I nor IGF-II counteracted the negative growth regulatory
     effect of CLA. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western
     blot analysis of total cell lysates revealed that CLA decreased IGF-I
     receptor (IGF-IR) transcript and protein levels in a dose-dependent
     manner. Immunoprecipitation/Western blot studies revealed that CLA
     inhibited IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR and insulin-receptor
     substrate (IRS)-1, recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to IGF-IR, IGF-IR-associated PI3K
     activity, and phosphorylated Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase
     (ERK)-1/2 levels. In conclusion, the inhibition of cell proliferation and
     induction of apoptosis by CLA in HT-29 cells may be mediated in part by
     its ability to decrease IGF-II synthesis and to downregulate IGF-IR
     signaling and the PI3K/Akt and ERK-1/2 pathways.

PG  - 40442-54
AB  - Because insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its receptor play a
     pivotal role in many cancers, it is an attractive target for the design of
     inhibitors. Here we present a new family of bioisostere inhibitors, based
     on the structure of AG 538. AG 538 is a substrate-competitive inhibitor of
     the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), with an IC50 = 61 nM in a cell-free kinase
     assay (Blum, G., Gazit, A., and Levitzki, A. (2000) Biochemistry 39,
     15705-15712). AG 538 is a low molecular weight compound containing two
     catechol rings, which are sensitive to oxidation in cells. We have
     therefore prepared and examined catechol bioisosteres of AG 538. These AG
     538 bioisosteres possess similar biological properties to AG 538; they
     inhibit IGF-1R by a substrate-competitive mechanism and are
     non-competitive vis a vis ATP. They inhibit IGF-1R kinase activity in the
     sub-micromolar concentration range in cell-free assays. IGF-1 induced
     IGF-1R autophosphorylation; IRS-1 phosphorylation and protein kinase B
     activation are inhibited at a low micromolar concentration range when
     applied to intact cells. These inhibitors also block the formation of
     colonies in soft agar by prostate and breast cancer cells. The ability to
     replace catechol groups with a moiety that is more stable in cells may aid
     in developing non-catechol-containing substrate-competitive inhibitors
     targeted toward IGF-1R and possibly against other protein-tyrosine
     kinases.

     cells.
PG  - 239-45
AB  - Maternal hyperglycemia alters placental glucose metabolism and induces
     placental hypercellularity. In this study we investigated, in JAr cells,
     the effect of a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate, on the
     insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1)-mitogen-activated protein kinase
     (MAPK) pathway and on cell proliferation in the presence of normal or high
     glucose concentration. When JAr cells were cultured in the presence of 25
     mmol/l glucose, treatment with vanadate completely prevented SHP-2
     association with IRS1. However, vanadate treatment reverted the effect of
     high glucose on basal and insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and IRS1
     phosphorylation. Similar effects were observed on MAPK activation. These
     events determined a related modification in cell proliferation. Indeed,
     after high glucose and vanadate treatment, thymidine incorporation levels
     were comparable to those observed in the presence of normal glucose
     concentration and in the absence of vanadate. Therefore, in JAr cells,
     vanadate exerts an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. This action is
     related to a modulation of the SHP-2 association with IRS1 that in turn
     might regulate the phosphorylation state of the main substrates involved
     in mitogenesic signaling of the insulin receptor.

     rat prostate cancer cell proliferation and apoptotic resistance in vitro
     via inhibition of intracellular signaling pathways involving tyrosine
     kinase.
PG  - 2367-76
AB  - We examined the ability of polyphenols from tomatoes and soy (genistein,
     quercetin, kaempferol, biochanin A, daidzein and rutin) to modulate
     insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-induced in vitro proliferation and
     apoptotic resistance in the AT6.3 rat prostate cancer cell line. IGF-I at
     50 micro g/L in serum-free medium produced maximum proliferation and
     minimized apoptosis. Polyphenols exhibited different abilities to modulate
     IGF-I-induced proliferation, cell cycle progression (flow cytometry) and
     apoptosis (Annexin V/propidium iodide and terminal
     deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nick end
     labeling). Genistein, quercetin, kaempferol and biochanin A exhibited
     dose-dependent inhibition of growth with a 50% inhibitory concentration
     (IC(50)) between 25 and 40 micro mol/L, whereas rutin and daidzein were
     less potent with an IC(50) of >60 micro mol/L. Genistein and kaempferol
     potently induced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest. Genistein, quercetin,
     kaempferol and biochanin A, but not daidzein and rutin, counteracted the
     antiapoptotic effects of IGF-I. Human prostate epithelial cells grown in
     growth factor-supplemented medium were also sensitive to growth inhibition
     by polyphenols. Genistein, biochanin A, quercetin and kaempferol reduced
     the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) content of AT6.3 cells and
     prevented the down-regulation of IGF-I receptor beta in response to IGF-I
     binding. IGF-I-stimulated proliferation was dependent on activation of
     mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
     (ERK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase pathways. Western blotting
     demonstrated that ERK1/2 was constitutively phosphorylated in AT6.3 cells
     with no change in response to IGF-I, whereas IRS-1 and AKT were rapidly
     and sensitively phosphorylated after IGF-I stimulation. Several
     polyphenols suppressed phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2, and more
     potently inhibited IRS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation after IGF-I exposure. In
     summary, polyphenols from soy and tomato products may counteract the
     ability of IGF-I to stimulate proliferation and prevent apoptosis via
     inhibition of multiple intracellular signaling pathways involving tyrosine
     kinase activity.

TI  - Estrogen receptor-alpha regulates the degradation of insulin receptor
     substrates 1 and 2 in breast cancer cells.
PG  - 4007-16
AB  - In breast cancer cells, 17-beta-estradiol (E2) upregulates the expression
     of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), a molecule transmitting
     insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signals through the PI-3K/Akt
     survival pathways. The stimulation of IRS-1 by E2 has been documented on
     the transcriptional level. Here we studied whether the expression of
     estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha affects IRS molecules post-transcriptionally.
     We used ER-alpha-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and MDA-MB-231
     cells with re-expressed ER-alpha. In MDA-MB-231 cells cultured under
     serum-free conditions, IRS-1 and IRS-2 were degraded through the 26S
     proteasome and calpain pathways. Re-expression of ER-alpha in MDA-MB-231
     cells correlated with enhanced stability of IRS molecules. This effect
     coincided with significantly reduced ubiquitination of IRS-1 and IRS-2,
     but did not involve increased IRS-1 and IRS-2 transcription. The
     interference of ER-alpha with IRS-1 and IRS-2 turnover could rely on the
     competition for common degradation pathways, as in MDA-MB-231/ER cells,
     ER-alpha processing was blocked by proteasome and calpain inhibitors.
     Notably, a fraction of the cytosolic ER-alpha colocalized and
     coprecipitated with IRS-1 and IRS-2, indicating a possible common
     destination for these proteins. The stabilization of IRS-1 in
     MDA-MB-231/ER cells was paralleled by the upregulation of the
     IRS-1/Akt/GSK-3 pathway and improved survival in the presence of IGF-I,
     whereas IRS-2 was not involved in IGF-I signaling.

AB  - Protein tyrosine phosphatases regulate signal transduction pathways
     involving tyrosine phosphorylation and have been implicated in the
     development of cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension.
     Increasing evidence suggests that the cellular redox state is involved in
     regulating tyrosine phosphatase activity through the reversible
     oxidization of the catalytic cysteine to sulphenic acid (Cys-SOH). But how
     further oxidation to the irreversible sulphinic (Cys-SO2H) and sulphonic
     (Cys-SO3H) forms is prevented remains unclear. Here we report the crystal
     structures of the regulatory sulphenic and irreversible sulphinic and
     sulphonic acids of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), an important
     enzyme in the negative regulation of the insulin receptor and a
     therapeutic target in type II diabetes and obesity. We also identify a
     sulphenyl-amide species that is formed through oxidation of its catalytic
     cysteine. Formation of the sulphenyl-amide causes large changes in the
     PTP1B active site, which are reversible by reduction with the cellular
     reducing agent glutathione. The sulphenyl-amide is a protective
     intermediate in the oxidative inhibition of PTP1B. In addition, it may
     facilitate reactivation of PTP1B by biological thiols and signal a unique
     state of the protein.

     pathways in human breast tumor cells.
PG  - 331-45
AB  - Estrogens and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) act as mitogens promoting
     cell proliferation in normal breast tissue as well as in breast
     carcinomas. Both hormones have been shown to play a role in the
     development of breast cancer and were found to activate multiple signaling
     pathways leading to proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines in
     vitro. Originally, it was considered that these agents manifest their
     mitogenic actions through separate pathways, but a growing body of
     evidence suggests that the IGF- and estrogen-mediated signaling pathways
     are intertwined. 17beta-Estradiol (E2) has been shown to enhance IGF
     signaling at multiple levels. E2 treatment of breast cancer cells alters
     expression of nearly all of the IGF family members including IGF-I,
     IGF-II, IGF-binding proteins, IGF type I receptor (IGF-RI), and insulin
     receptor substrate 1. The ligand-bound estrogen receptor has been reported
     to bind to and to activate the IGF-RI directly. Vice versa, IGF signaling
     has been reported to enhance estrogen receptor activation in human breast
     cancer cells by inducing phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor.
     Finally, several groups have described synergistic effects of the
     combination of E2 and IGF-I on S phase entry in breast tumor cell lines.
     Here, we review recent, often contradictory, reports describing the
     effects of E2 and IGFs on the proliferation of breast tumor cells, with
     special emphasis on the synergistic effects of the two hormones.

TI  - The FRK/RAK-SHB signaling cascade: a versatile signal-transduction pathway
     that regulates cell survival, differentiation and proliferation.
PG  - 313-24
AB  - Recent experiments have unravelled novel signal transduction pathways that
     involve the SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain adapter protein SHB. SHB is
     ubiquitously expressed and contains proline rich motifs, a phosphotyrosine
     binding (PTB) domain, tyrosine phosphorylation sites and an SH2 domain and
     serves a role in generating signaling complexes in response to tyrosine
     kinase activation. SHB mediates certain responses in platelet-derived
     growth factor (PDGF) receptor-, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor-,
     neural growth factor (NGF) receptor TRKA-, T cell receptor-, interleukin-2
     (IL-2) receptor- and focal adhesion kinase- (FAK) signaling. Upstream of
     SHB in some cells lies the SRC-like FYN-Related Kinase FRK/RAK (also named
     BSK/IYK or GTK). FRK/RAK and SHB exert similar effects when overexpressed
     in rat phaeochromocytoma (PC12) and beta-cells, where they both induce
     PC12 cell differentiation and beta-cell proliferation. Furthermore,
     beta-cell apoptosis is augmented by these proteins under conditions that
     cause beta-cell degeneration. The FRK/RAK-SHB responses involve FAK and
     insulin receptor substrates (IRS) -1 and -2. Besides regulating apoptosis,
     proliferation and differentiation, SHB is also a component of the T cell
     receptor (TCR) signaling response. In Jurkat T cells, SHB links several
     signaling components with the TCR and is thus required for IL-2
     production. In endothelial cells, SHB both promotes apoptosis under
     conditions that are anti-angiogenic, but is also required for proper
     mitogenicity, spreading and tubular morphogenesis. In embryonic stem
     cells, dominant-negative SHB (R522K) prevents early cavitation of embryoid
     bodies and reduces differentiation to cells expressing albumin, amylase,
     insulin and glucagon, suggesting a role of SHB in development. In summary,
     SHB is a versatile signal transduction molecule that produces diverse
     biological responses in different cell types under various conditions. SHB
     operates downstream of GTK in cells that express this kinase.

TI  - Retinoic acid-induced growth arrest of MCF-7 cells involves the selective
     regulation of the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway.
PG  - 3353-60
AB  - In the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)
     are known to elicit antiproliferative actions via the insulin receptor
     substrate-1 (IRS-1)/PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway. All-trans retinoic acid (RA)
     is a potent inhibitor of MCF-7 cell proliferation, but the mechanism by
     which growth regulation is achieved remains unclear. We investigated the
     effects of RA on the regulation of the IGF-IR and its key signaling
     elements: IRS-1, IRS-2, and SHC. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with RA caused a
     significant reduction in IRS-1 protein and tyrosine phosphorylation levels
     at a concentration and time consistent with RA-mediated growth inhibition.
     IRS-1 regulation is selective, as RA did not influence IRS-2 or SHC
     levels. Downstream signaling events were also selectively reduced, as RA
     abrogated IGF-I-stimulated AKT activation but did not alter erk1/2
     activation. To confirm the importance of IRS-1 regulation by RA, we
     examined the response to RA in MCF-7 cells overexpressing IGF-IR and
     IRS-1. RA resistance was observed in MCF-7 cells overexpressing IRS-1 but
     not IGF-IR. This suggests that RA-mediated growth inhibition requires the
     selective downregulation of IRS-1 and AKT. Therapeutic agents targeting
     the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway may enhance the cytostatic effects of RA
     in breast cancer, since overexpression of IRS-1 and AKT have been reported
     in primary breast tumors.

TI  - The insulin-like growth factor system and cancer.
PG  - 127-37
AB  - The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family of ligands, binding proteins
     and receptors is an important growth factor system involved in both the
     development of the organism and the maintenance of normal function of many
     cells of the body. The system also has powerful anti-apoptotic effects.
     More recently, evidence has accrued to demonstrate that the IGFs play an
     important role in cancer. Individuals with serum IGF-II levels in the
     upper quartile of the normal range (and IGF binding protein-3 levels in
     the lower quartiles) have a relative risk for developing breast, prostate,
     colon and lung cancer. IGF-II is commonly expressed by tumor cells and may
     act as an autocrine growth factor; occasionally even reaching target
     tissues and causing tumor-induced hypoglycemia. The IGF-I receptor is
     commonly (though not always) overexpressed in many cancers, and many
     recent studies have identified new signaling pathways emanating from the
     IGF-I receptor that affect cancer cell proliferation, adhesion, migration
     and cell death; functions that are critical for cancer cell survival and
     metastases. In this review, many aspects of the IGF system and its
     relationship to cancer will be discussed.

     functional up-regulation of Fas receptor.
PG  - 803-10
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Insulin- and insulin growth factor-1 stimulated signaling
     through the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) promotes hepatocellular
     proliferation and survival. IRS-1 over-expression in transgenic (Tg) mouse
     livers caused constitutive activation of Erk mitogen activated protein
     kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) resulting in
     significantly increased levels of DNA synthesis and larger hepatic masses
     relative to non-transgenic (non-Tg) littermates. However, the livers
     eventually ceased to grow but remained approximately 25% larger than
     non-Tg livers. We hypothesized that this growth homeostasis was achieved
     by parallel activation of pro-apoptosis pathways. METHODS: Since
     Fas-mediated apoptosis is a common mechanism of hepatocyte destruction, we
     investigated the potential role of Fas receptor as a regulator of hepatic
     mass in IRS-1 transgenic mice. RESULTS: Significantly increased
     Fas-receptor levels were detected in the livers of IRS-1 Tg compared to
     non-Tg mice by Western blot analysis. Functional activation of
     Fas-receptor in IRS-1 Tg livers was demonstrated by increased
     hepatocellular apoptosis caused by intravenous injection of anti-Fas
     (Jo-2). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the increased growth
     caused by IRS-1 over-expression is balanced by constitutive activation of
     pro-death mechanisms. Failure of the IRS-1 Tg mice to develop liver cancer
     may be due to preservation of pro-growth, pro-death homeostasis
     mechanisms.

PG  - 2650-8
AB  - The A isoform of the insulin receptor (IR) is frequently overexpressed in
     cancer cells and is activated by IGF-II as well as by insulin, whereas the
     B isoform is predominant in differentiated tissues and responds poorly to
     IGF-II. The IR substrate-1 (IRS-1), a docking protein for the IR, is known
     to send a mitogenic signal and to be a powerful inhibitor of cell
     differentiation. We have investigated the biological effects of the two IR
     isoforms in parental 32D hemopoietic cells, which do not express IRS-1,
     and in 32D-derived cells in which IRS-1 is ectopically expressed. The
     effects of the two isoforms on cell survival, differentiation markers and
     nuclear translocation of IRS-1 were compared. The results confirm that the
     A isoform responds to IGF-II and preferentially sends mitogenic,
     antiapoptotic signals, whereas the B form, poorly responsive to IGF-II,
     tends to send differentiation signals.

     hybrid receptors.
PG  - 2388-95
AB  - IGF-I stimulates insulin-like actions directly through its receptor, and
     it also enhances sensitivity to insulin-mediated effects in vivo. These
     studies were undertaken to analyze the role of IGF-I, insulin, and
     insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors (HRs) in mediating IGF-I and insulin
     signaling in cells that had been made insulin-resistant by treatment with
     glucosamine. Human HepG2 cells, which express IGF-I receptors, insulin
     receptors (IRs), and IGF-I/insulin HRs, were exposed to 20 mM glucosamine;
     and the effects of IGF-I and insulin in stimulating glycogen synthesis
     were determined. An overnight exposure to glucosamine markedly attenuated
     the effects of insulin and IGF-I in stimulating glycogen synthesis. To
     determine which receptors were mediating this effect, the ability of
     insulin and IGF-I to stimulate phosphorylation of their respective
     receptors was analyzed. An 18-h exposure to glucosamine (20 mM) caused a
     75% reduction in the ability of IGF-I to phosphorylate its receptor but no
     change in receptor abundance. Glucosamine also caused a major reduction in
     insulin-stimulated receptor phosphorylation, although, unlike IGF-I, there
     was also a 50% reduction in IR abundance. Exposure to glucosamine also
     resulted in a reduction in the ability of IGF-I or insulin to stimulate
     phosphorylation of insulin IGF-I/HRs. The combination of insulin plus
     IGF-I was a more potent stimulus of HR phosphorylation than either agent
     alone, and this combination was also more potent in partially reversing
     the inhibitory effect of glucosamine. Taken together, these findings
     indicate that glucosamine induces a loss of sensitivity to stimulation of
     insulin, IGF-I, or HR tyrosine kinase activity by insulin or IGF-I.
     Although insulin is able to partially reverse the effect of glucosamine on
     IR phosphorylation, it has a very minimal effect on glucosamine-induced
     inhibition of HR phosphorylation. However, the combination of IGF-I and
     insulin induces a major increase in HR phosphorylation, even in the
     presence of glucosamine, suggesting that it is improving the sensitivity
     of the HR to insulin activation.

TI  - The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and its role in
     interferon signaling.
PG  - 129-42
AB  - Interferons (IFNs) are pleiotropic cytokines that exhibit multiple
     biological effects on cells and tissues. IFN receptors are expressed
     widely in mammalian cells and virtually all different cell types express
     them on their surface. The Type I IFN receptor has a multichain structure,
     composed of at least two distinct receptor subunits, IFNalphaR1 and
     IFNalphaR2. Two Jak-kinases, Tyk-2 and Jak-1, associate with the different
     receptor subunits and are activated in response to IFNalpha or IFNbeta to
     regulate engagement of multiple downstream signaling cascades. These
     include the Stat-pathway, whose function is essential for transcriptional
     activation of IFN-sensitive genes, and the insulin receptor substrate
     pathway, which regulates downstream activation of the
     phosphatidyl-inositol-3' kinase. Members of the Map family of kinases are
     also activated by the Type I IFN receptor and participate in the
     generation of IFN signals. The p38 Map kinase pathway appears to play a
     very important role in the induction of IFN responses. p38 is rapidly
     activated during engagement of the Type I IFN receptor, and such an
     activation is regulated by the small G-protein Rac1, which functions as
     its upstream effector in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. The activated
     form of p38 regulates downstream activation of other serine kinases,
     notably MapKapK-2 and MapKapK-3, indicating the existence of Type I
     IFN-dependent signaling cascades activated downstream of p38. Extensive
     studies have shown that p38 plays a critical role in Type I IFN-dependent
     transcriptional regulation, without modifying activation of the
     Stat-pathway. It is now well established that the function of p38 is
     essential for gene transcription via ISRE or GAS elements, but has no
     effects on the phosphorylation of Stat-proteins, the formation of
     Stat-complexes, and their binding to the promoters of IFN-sensitive genes.
     As Type I IFNs regulate gene expression for proteins with antiviral
     properties, it is not surprising that pharmacological inhibition of the
     p38 pathway blocks induction of IFNalpha-antiviral responses. In addition,
     pharmacological inhibition of p38 abrogates the suppressive effects of
     Type I IFNs on normal human hematopoietic progenitors, indicating a
     critical role for this signaling cascade in the induction of the
     regulatory effects of Type I IFNs on hematopoiesis. p38 is also activated
     during IFNalpha-treatment of primary leukemia cells from patients with
     chronic myelogenous leukemia. Such activation is required for
     IFNalpha-dependent suppression of leukemic cell progenitor growth,
     indicating that this pathway plays a critical role in the induction of the
     antileukemic effects of IFNalpha.

PG  - 313-6
AB  - To study the regulatory effect of acute and chronic insulin treatment on
     insulin post-receptor signaling transduction pathway in a human hepatoma
     cell line (Hep G2), Hep G2 cells were incubated in the presence or absence
     of insulin with different concentrations in serum free media for 16 h and
     then stimulated with 100 nmol/L insulin for 1 min. Protein levels of
     insulin receptor beta-subunit (IR beta), insulin receptor substrate-1
     (IRS-1) and p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)
     were determined in total cell lysates by Western-immunoblot.
     Phosphorylated proteins IR beta, IRS-1 and interaction of PI 3-kinase with
     IRS-1 were determined by immunoprecipitation. Results showed that 1-min
     insulin stimulation rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IR beta
     and IRS-1, which in turn, resulting in association of PI 3-kinase with
     IRS-1. 1-100 nmol/L chronic insulin treatment induced a dose-dependent
     decrease in the protein level of IR beta and a slight decrease in the
     protein level of IRS-1. There was a more marked reduction in the
     phosphorylation of IR beta, IRS-1, reaching a nadir of 22% (P < 0.01) and
     15% (P < 0.01) of control levels, respectively, after 16 h treatment with
     100 nmol/L insulin. The association between IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase was
     decreased by 66% (P < 0.01). There was no significant change in PI
     3-kinase protein levels. These data suggest that chronic insulin treatment
     can induce alterations of IR beta, IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase three early steps
     in insulin action, which contributes significantly to insulin resistance,
     and may account for desensitization of insulin action.

TI  - A nucleoprotein complex containing Sp1, C/EBP beta, and HMGI-Y controls
     human insulin receptor gene transcription.
PG  - 2720-32
AB  - HMGI-Y is an architectural transcription factor that regulates gene
     expression in vivo by controlling the formation of stereospecific
     multiprotein complexes on the AT-rich regions of certain gene promoters.
     Recently, we demonstrated that HMGI-Y is required for proper transcription
     of the insulin receptor (IR) gene. Here we provide evidence that
     transcriptional activation of the human IR promoter requires the assembly
     of a transcriptionally active multiprotein-DNA complex which includes, in
     addition to HMGI-Y, the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Sp1
     and the CCAAT-enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP beta). Functional
     integrity of this nucleoprotein complex is required for full
     transactivation of the IR gene by Sp1 and C/EBP beta in cells readily
     expressing IRs. We show that HMGI-Y physically interacts with Sp1 and
     C/EBP beta and facilitates the binding of both factors to the IR promoter
     in vitro. Furthermore, HMGI-Y is needed for transcriptional synergism
     between these factors in vivo. Repression of HMGI-Y function adversely
     affects both Sp1- and C/EBP beta-induced transactivation of the IR
     promoter. Together, these findings demonstrate that HMGI-Y plays
     significant molecular roles in the transcriptional activities of these
     factors in the context of the IR gene and provide concordant support for
     the hypothesis that, in affected individuals, a putative defect in these
     nuclear proteins may cause decreased IR expression with subsequent
     impairment of insulin signaling and action.

     via MAP kinase activation in a glucose-dependent fashion.
PG  - 385-91
AB  - Leptin and glucose effect on cell growth has been investigated in the JAr
     human choriocarcinoma cells. When JAr cells were cultured in the presence
     of 6m M glucose (LG), proliferation and thymidine incorporation were
     induced by serum but not by leptin. At variance, at 25m M glucose (HG),
     proliferation and thymidine incorporation were stimulated by leptin and
     serum to a comparable extent. HG culturing also enhanced leptin-stimulated
     insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and MAPK phosphorylation. Blockage of
     MAPK activity with PD98059 caused an inhibition of glucose- and
     leptin-dependent thymidine incorporation. At variance with HG conditions
     no effects were observed in cells cultured in 6m M glucose upon treatment
     with PD98059. Neither glucose nor leptin determined a modification in
     leptin receptors total content.In this study, we provide evidence that in
     placental cells, leptin, similarly to that observed with insulin,
     stimulates cell proliferation by inducing the IRS1/MAPK pathway in a
     glucose-dependent fashion.

TI  - The tyrphostin AG1024 accelerates the degradation of phosphorylated forms
     of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and restores pRb tumor suppressive
     function in melanoma cells.
PG  - 1420-9
AB  - Constitutive cell surface receptor kinase signaling and persistent
     phosphorylation/inactivation of the retinoblastoma (pRb) family of
     proteins (pRb, p107 and p130, known as pocket proteins) have been
     implicated in conferring uncontrolled growth to melanoma cells. However,
     the signals linking receptor kinase activity to neutralization of pocket
     proteins have not yet been fully elucidated. We therefore used specific
     chemical inhibitors to examine pRb regulation in melanoma cells. The most
     efficient agent, AG1024, known as an inhibitor of insulin-like growth
     factor 1 receptor and insulin receptor, arrested melanoma cell growth in
     vitro at nanomolar concentrations within 24 h of application. AG1024
     inhibited the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
     signal-regulated kinase pathway and restored pRb tumor suppressive
     function. The latter was observed by the reduction in the phosphorylated
     forms of pRb, p107 and p130, and the formation of growth suppressive DNA
     binding complexes consisting of pRb and E2F1 or E2F3. The loss of
     phosphorylated forms of pRb at early time points after AG1024 application
     was not associated with suppression of cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4
     activity but rather with proteasomal and nonproteasomal degradation. Thus,
     inhibition of melanoma cell proliferation by AG1024 is mediated by
     inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
     signal-regulated kinase 2 signaling and activation of pRb by a mechanism
     involving protein degradation.

PG  - 1054-65
AB  - Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that p190-B RhoGAP
     (p190-B) is differentially expressed in the Cap cells of terminal end buds
     (TEBs) and poorly differentiated rodent mammary tumors. Based on these
     observations we hypothesized that p190-B might play an essential role in
     invasion of the TEBs into the surrounding fat pad during ductal
     morphogenesis. To test this hypothesis, mammary development was studied in
     p190-B-deficient mice. A haploinsufficiency phenotype was observed in
     p190-B heterozygous mice as indicated by decreased number and rate of
     ductal outgrowth(s) at 3, 4, and 5 wk of age when compared with their
     wild-type littermates. This appeared to result from decreased
     proliferation in the Cap cells of the TEBs, a phenotype remarkably similar
     to that observed previously in IGF-I receptor null mammary epithelium.
     Furthermore, decreased expression of insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2
     were observed in TEBs of p190-B heterozygous mice. These findings are
     consistent with decreased IGF signaling observed previously in p190-B-/-
     mouse embryo fibroblasts. To further assess if this defect was cell
     autonomous or due to systemic endocrine effects, the mammary anlagen from
     p190-B+/+, p190-B+/-, and p190-B-/- mice was rescued by transplantation
     into the cleared fat pad of recipient Rag1-/- mice. Surprisingly, as
     opposed to 75-80% outgrowths observed using wild-type donor epithelium,
     only 40% of the heterozygous and none of the p190-B-/- epithelial
     transplants displayed any outgrowths. Together, these results suggest that
     p190-B regulates ductal morphogenesis, at least in part, by modulating the
     IGF signaling axis.

TI  - The polycystic ovary syndrome: what does insulin resistance have to do
     with it?
PG  - 36-42
AB  - About half of infertility cases are attributable to female factors, of
     which anovulation is the leading cause. Most cases of anovulation are due
     to the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Clinically PCOS, present in 5%
     of all women, consists of anovulation, acne, hirsutism, reversed LH-to-FSH
     ratio and often resistance to insulin. In some cases PCOS appears in
     familial clusters but its genetic cause is unknown. Several genes were
     suggested as possible culprits for PCOS but their involvement has not been
     proven. The central paradox regarding the role of insulin in PCOS is the
     high responsiveness to insulin by the ovary, as opposed to the resistance
     of the whole body. On the backdrop of knowledge of several paralogous
     genes for each of the participating proteins in the insulin signal
     transduction pathways, it is possible that different paralogues propagate
     the intracellular signal in the ovary as opposed to peripheral tissues.
     Studies by microarray techniques of the different gene expression profiles
     in the two ovarian cells and peripheral cells such as adipocytes could
     clarify whether the ovarian defect in PCOS is identical to the peripheral
     defect in insulin signal transduction, or whether serum insulin
     concentrations simply serve to reveal the ovarian defect.

TI  - Focal overexpression of insulin-like growth factor 2 by hepatocytes and
     cholangiocytes in viral liver cirrhosis.
PG  - 733-9
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2 is overexpressed in hepatocellular
     carcinoma and accompanying dysplastic lesions. IGF-2 signalling is
     mediated through IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), while mannose
     6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-2 receptor (M6P/IGF-2R) controls
     pericellular levels of free IGF-2. We studied, by in situ hybridisation
     and immunohistology, 18 liver specimens with cirrhosis of different
     aetiology without neoplastic or dysplastic lesions. Immunohistology was
     also performed for insulin receptor IGF-1R and IGF-binding proteins 3 and
     4. High focal levels of IGF-2 RNA were found in some hepatocytes of all
     livers with HBV- or HCV-induced cirrhosis (n=10), but in only one of the
     cirrhoses with nonviral aetiology (n=8). IGF-2 was overexpressed in
     biliary duct epithelial cells in one case. Compared with noncirrhotic
     liver, all cirrhotic specimens showed reduced hepatocellular expression of
     M6P/IGF-2R protein, which contrasted with enhanced expression in
     perisinusoidal cells. Immunostaining for the other antigens did not reveal
     significant differences. Upregulation of IGF-2 in some hepatocytes may
     lead to high focal IGF-2 levels sufficient to saturate local IGF-2 binding
     capacities, and may result in an increased susceptibility to cellular
     dedifferentiation and, ultimately, liver cancer. Downregulation of
     hepatocellular M6P/IGF-2R and upregulation of IGF-2 seem to be early
     events in hepatocarcinogenesis prior to the appearance of morphologically
     distinct dysplastic lesions. Elevated focal IGF-2 transcript levels may
     therefore indicate an increased risk for hepatocellular and
     cholangiocellular carcinomas.

PG  - 385-94
AB  - Insulin and growth hormone (GH) induce mitogenic and metabolic signals in
     cells, GH either directly or indirectly via IGF-I production. We have
     studied a spontaneous murine T-cell lymphoma (LB cells) devoid of IGF-1
     receptors in which proliferation is maintained by insulin [Int. J. Cancer
     50 (1992) 80], and show that GH is more potent than insulin, with both GH
     and insulin dose-response curves for thymidine incorporation being
     bell-shaped. Binding showed somatogenic rather than lactogenic GH
     receptors. Insulin stimulated phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and
     of a 160-kDa protein, identified as the IRS-4 protein. This phosphorylated
     IRS-4 associated with PI3-kinase, which was activated along with the
     downstream p70(S6) kinase, whereas the Ras-MAPK pathway was not. Using
     selective inhibitors, the PI3-kinase, but not p70(S6) kinase or MEK, was
     found to be involved in insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis. GH induced
     tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-4 and nuclear translocation of STAT5. The
     LB cells constitute a new model for studying GH and insulin signalling
     without interference of IGF-1 receptors.

TI  - The HIV protease inhibitor indinavir impairs glycogen synthesis in HepG2
     hepatoma cells.
PG  - 16-20
AB  - HIV protease inhibitor treatment is associated with insulin resistance. We
     have recently demonstrated that the HIV protease inhibitor indinavir
     influences initial insulin signaling steps in HepG2 cells. Here we
     investigated in the same cell model whether indinavir alters
     insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. Since an altered phosphotyrosine
     phosphatase activity could represent a mechanism by which insulin
     signaling is influenced, we also assessed potential indinavir effects on
     protein tyrosine phosphatase activity directed against tyrosine
     phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1. HepG2 cells were incubated
     for 48 h without or with indinavir (100 micro mol/l). Subsequently, the
     insulin-stimulated incorporation of 14C-glucose into glycogen was
     measured. In indinavir-treated cells the insulin effect on glycogen
     synthesis was reduced by 30 +/- 4.5 %. Dephosphorylation of immobilized
     tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin-receptor substrate-1 by the cell extracts
     was determined using a microwell plate-based method, and indinavir
     treatment did not alter this dephosphorylation. In conclusion, our data
     suggest that indinavir affects insulin-stimulation of glycogen synthesis
     in liver cells, and this may be related to the previously observed
     alterations in insulin signaling. Direct effects of indinavir on the GLUT4
     transport system, that have been suggested from data in other cell
     systems, are unlikely in HepG2 cells that express no or almost no GLUT4
     transport system. Finally, our data do not support the hypothesis that
     indinavir alters insulin signaling by influencing protein tyrosine
     phosphatase activity directed against insulin receptor substrate-1.

TI  - The efficacy of small interfering RNAs targeted to the type 1 insulin-like
     growth factor receptor (IGF1R) is influenced by secondary structure in the
     IGF1R transcript.
PG  - 15991-7
AB  - The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) is often
     overexpressed by tumors and mediates growth and apoptosis protection. We
     previously showed that antisense reagents complementary to the IGF1R
     translation start site enhance radio- and chemosensitivity and impair Atm
     function. However these agents induce relatively modest IGF1R
     down-regulation and affect insulin receptor levels. To identify
     alternative sites for molecular targeting, we utilized scanning
     oligonucleotide arrays to probe the secondary structure of IGF1R mRNA.
     This strategy enabled selection of antisense oligonucleotides that
     generated high heteroduplex yield with IGF1R but not insulin receptor
     transcripts. Antisense oligonucleotides that hybridized strongly to IGF1R
     mRNA caused IGF1R down-regulation within intact tumor cells, whereas
     weakly hybridizing oligonucleotides were inactive. Furthermore, the
     ability of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to block IGF1R expression
     correlated with the accessibility of the target sequence within the
     transcript. Thus, siRNAs corresponding to weakly hybridizing
     oligonucleotides caused minor IGF1R down-regulation, whereas siRNAs
     homologous to accessible targets induced profound sequence-specific IGF1R
     gene silencing, blocked IGF signaling, and enhanced tumor cell
     radiosensitivity. This indicates that secondary structure in the target
     transcript has a major effect on siRNA efficacy. These findings have
     implications for siRNA design and suggest that IGF1R-targeting agents
     incorporating this mode of action have potential as anticancer therapy.

PG  - 627-35
AB  - Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) stimulate breast cancer proliferation,

     of MCF-7 cells in athymic mice. In this study, we have examined the
     effects of scFv-Fc on IGF1R signaling in the estrogen receptor-positive
     (ER+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The antibody
     stimulated IGF1R activation in vitro in MCF-7 cells and was unable to
     block IGF-I effects. The antibody also stimulated proliferation of MCF-7
     cells in monolayer growth assays. To determine how scFv-Fc could stimulate
     in vitro growth yet inhibit in vivo tumor growth, we examined the effect
     of scFv-Fc on IGF1R expression. In MCF-7 cells, scFv-Fc down-regulated
     IGF1R levels after 2 h, and the levels were greatly reduced after 24 h. In
     contrast, IGF-I treatment over the same time period did not affect IGF1R
     levels. Twenty-four-h pretreatment of cells with scFv-Fc blocked IGF-I
     mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and subsequent
     extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/extracellular signal-regulated
     kinase 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activation. In contrast, cells
     treated with 5 nM IGF-I for 24 h still retained the ability to further
     activate downstream signaling pathways in response to IGF-I. Moreover,
     pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with scFv-Fc rendered them refractory to
     further proliferation induced by additional IGF-I. Twenty-four-h
     pretreatment of cells with scFv-Fc also inhibited IGF-I stimulated
     anchorage-independent growth. scFv-Fc did not enhance antibody-dependent
     cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In vivo, treatment of mice bearing MCF-7
     xenograft tumors with scFv-Fc resulted in near complete down-regulation of
     IGF1R. Our data show that scFv-Fc stimulates biochemical activation of
     IGF1R, then causes receptor down-regulation, making MCF-7 cells refractory
     to additional IGF-I exposure. These results indicate that such chimeric
     single-chain antibodies against IGF1R have future potential in breast
     cancer therapy by causing down-regulation of receptor.

TI  - An inhibitory function for JNK in the regulation of IGF-I signaling in
     breast cancer.
PG  - 602-14
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) is frequently overexpressed
     in a variety of cancer types. Since many breast tumors and cancer cell
     lines overexpress IGF-IR, we tested IGF-I effects on chemotherapy-treated
     breast cancer cells. IGF-I protects from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis,
     suggesting that overlapping signaling pathways modulate IGF-I and
     chemotherapy treatment outcomes. Taxol and other chemotherapy drugs induce
     c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a kinase that conveys cellular stress and
     death signals. Notably, in this paper we show that IGF-I alone induces a
     potent JNK response and this activity is reversed by inhibition of
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) with LY294002 in MCF-7 but not
     T47D cells. Cotreatment of cells with chemotherapy and IGF-I leads to
     additive JNK responses. Using cells overexpressing Akt, we confirm that
     IGF-I-mediated survival is Akt dependent. In contrast, overexpression of
     JNK significantly enhances Taxol-induced apoptosis and inhibits IGF-I
     survival effects. Further, JNK attenuates anchorage-independent growth of
     MCF-7 cells. The inhibitory effect of JNK appears to be mediated by serine
     phosphorylation of IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate) since both Taxol and
     IGF-I treatment enhanced Ser(312) IRS-1 phosphorylation, while LY294002
     blocked IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation. Taken together, these data provide
     a mechanism whereby stress or growth factors activate JNK to reduce
     proliferation and/or survival in breast cancer cells.

     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- and extracellular signal-regulated protein
     kinase-dependent signaling pathways in HepG2 cells.
PG  - 147-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Insulin has well-known activities in controlling energy
     metabolism, cellular proliferation and biosynthesis of functional
     molecules to maintain a biological homeostasis. Recently, several studies
     have suggested that insulin may protect cells from apoptosis in different
     cell lines; however, little is known about the nature of its
     anti-apoptotic activity. In many clinical disorders, including type 2
     diabetes mellitus, oxidative stress and the production of reactive oxygen
     species (ROS) is increased. With these facts as a background, we examined
     here whether insulin protects HepG2 cells from apoptosis by decreasing
     oxidative stress and, if so, which signaling steps are involved in this
     process. METHODS: Intracellular DNA content, the degree of nuclear
     condensation or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase hydrolysis was measured to
     verify the occurrence of apoptotic events. Caspase-3 activity and ROS
     accumulation within cells were also measured. Western blot analysis was
     performed to identify signaling molecules activated in response to
     insulin. RESULTS: Serum starvation resulted in a marked accumulation of
     ROS, activation of caspase-3, and subsequent apoptotic cell death which
     were, in turn, markedly blocked by the addition of insulin. The
     anti-apoptotic activity of insulin was sensitive to blockade of two
     different signaling steps, activations of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
     (PI3 kinase) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK).
     CONCLUSION: Insulin exerts an anti-apoptotic activity by suppressing the
     excessive accumulation of ROS within cells through signaling pathways
     including stimulation of PI3 kinase and ERK in HepG2 cells.

     phosphatase (MKP-1) expression in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells.
PG  - 609-19
AB  - A contribution of intracellular dehydration to insulin resistance has been
     established in human subjects and in different experimental systems. Here
     the effect of hyperosmolarity (405 mosmol/l) on insulin-induced
     mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase (MKP)-1 expression was
     studied in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells. Insulin induces robust MKP-1
     expression which correlates with a vanadate-sensitive decay of
     extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (Erk-1/Erk-2) activity.
     Hyperosmolarity delays MKP-1 accumulation by insulin and this corresponds
     to impaired MKP-1 synthesis, whereas MKP-1 degradation remains unaffected
     by hyperosmolarity. Rapamycin, which inhibits signalling downstream from
     the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and a peptide inhibiting protein
     kinase C (PKC) zeta/lambda abolish insulin-induced MKP-1 protein but not
     mRNA expression, suggesting the involvement of the p70 ribosomal S6
     protein kinase (p70S6-kinase) and/or the eukaryotic initiation factor
     4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) as well as atypical PKCs in MKP-1
     translation. Hyperosmolarity induces sustained suppression of p70S6-kinase
     and 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation by insulin, whereas insulin-induced
     tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) beta subunit and the
     IR substrates IRS1 and IRS2, recruitment of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
     (PI 3-kinase) regulatory subunit p85 to the receptor substrates as well as
     PI 3-kinase activation, and Ser-473 phosphorylation of protein kinase B
     and Thr-410/403 phosphorylation of PKC zeta/lambda are largely unaffected
     under hyperosmotic conditions. The hyperosmotic impairment of both, MKP-1
     expression and p70S6-kinase hyperphosphorylation by insulin is insensitive
     to K(2)CrO(4), calyculin A and vanadate, and inhibition of the Erk-1/Erk-2
     and p38 pathways. The suppression of MKP-1 may further contribute to
     insulin resistance under dehydrating conditions by allowing unbalanced MAP
     kinase activation.

     chronically insulin-treated Hep G2 cells.
PG  - 55-60
AB  - AIM: To study the effect of chronic insulin treatment on insulin
     post-receptor signaling transduction and whether the effects of metformin
     are transmitted throughout the cascade of insulin signaling intermediates
     in a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2). METHODS: Hep G2 cells were
     incubated in serum free media containing either insulin 100 nmol/L or
     insulin 100 nmol/L plus different concentrations (0.01-10 mmol/L) of
     metformin for 16 h and then were stimulated with insulin 100 nmol/L for 1
     min. RESULTS: Chronic treatment of insulin 100 nmol/L induced a
     significant reduction in the phosphorylation and protein expression of
     IR?, IRS1 and IRS2, which therefore resulted in a downregulation of
     association of PI3K with IRS. Therapeutic concentrations (0.01-0.1 mmol/L)
     of metformin prevented the changes induced by chronic insulin treatment in
     these post-receptor components of insulin signaling pathway. Tyrosine
     phosphorylation of IR?, IRS1, and IRS2 was increased by 2.7 fold (P <
     0.01), 6.8 fold (P < 0.01), and 2.3 fold (P <0.01) of chronically
     insulin-treated cells alone, respectively, after metformin 0.1 mmol/L was
     added. The association of p85 with IRS1 and IRS2 was also increased from
     34 % to 86 % (P <0.01) and from 30 % to 92 % (P <0.01), respectively. In
     contrast, metformin in pharmacological concentration (1-10 mmol/L) further
     inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of IR?, IRS1, IRS2 and the interaction
     of PI3K with IRS. The association of IRS1 with p85 was further decreased
     by 58 % (P >0.05) and of IRS2 by 30 % (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Chronic
     insulin exposure of Hep G2 cells induces the downregulation of insulin
     signal transduction via PI3K pathway. The effect of metformin on insulin
     signaling transduction represent a primary mechanism of metformin action
     in insulin resistant state.

TI  - Reduction of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B increases insulin signaling
     in FAO hepatoma cells.
PG  - 261-7
AB  - Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) has been implicated as a negative
     regulator of insulin signaling. PTP1B dephosphorylates the insulin
     receptor and insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1/2), inhibiting the
     insulin-signaling pathway. PTP1B has been reported to be elevated in
     diabetes and insulin-resistant states. Conversely, PTP1B null mice have
     increased insulin sensitivity. To further investigate the effect of PTP1B
     reduction on insulin signaling, FAO rat hepatoma cells were transfected,
     by electroporation, with a specific PTP1B antisense oligonucleotide (ASO),
     or a control oligonucleotide. The PTP1B ASO caused a 50-70% reduction in
     PTP1B protein expression as measured by Western blot analysis. Upon
     insulin stimulation, an increase in the phosphorylation of the insulin
     receptor and insulin receptor substrates was observed, without any change
     in protein expression levels. Reduction of PTP1B expression in FAO cells
     also caused an increase in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB and
     GSK3, without any change in protein expression. These results demonstrate
     that reduction of PTP1B can modulate key insulin signaling events
     downstream of the insulin receptor.

PG  - 213-28
AB  - We have previously shown that the interleukin (IL)-4 signal transduction
     involves the Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS) in human colorectal
     carcinoma cells LS513. In the present study it was tested whether IL-4
     counters Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)-1 through competition at the IRS
     signal transduction pathway and, thus, induces a molecular "insulin
     resistance" or whether IL-4 invokes an alternative signal transduction.
     The activated receptors of IL-4 and IGF-I both docked to IRS-1 and IRS-2
     and invoked IRS complex formation with phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase,
     as assessed by immunoprecipitation and detection of the precipitated
     compounds by immunoblot analysis. Both, IL-4 and IGF-1, signaling pathways
     induced phosphorylation of Akt kinase in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner,
     as assessed by addition of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor Ly294002.
     Interleukin-4 stimulation induced mono-phosphorylation at serine residue
     S473 of Akt kinase but failed to activate the kinase. Insulin-like growth
     factor-1 stimulation invoked dual-phosphorylation at S473 and T308 of Akt
     kinase and subsequent activation of the kinase. When LS513 cells were
     treated with IL-4 to induce mono-phosphorylation of Akt, dual-
     phosphorylation and activation of Akt kinase in response to IGF-1 were
     still intact. Interleukin-4 yet reduced cell growth by at least 50% both,
     in the absence and presence of growth factor IGF-1. In the LS513 cells,
     IL-4 stimulated phosphorylation of Jak2, an adapter molecule at the IL-4
     receptor, and phosphorylation of transcription factor Stat6 both, in the
     absence and presence of IGF-1. We found a similar IL-4 signal transduction
     and growth suppression in multiple human cell cultures, including primary
     cells. Our findings indicate that the molecular mechanism underlying
     growth suppression by IL-4 may depend on gene-expression but not on
     "insulin/growth factor resistance" at IRS.

TI  - Differential responses of EGFR-/AGT-expressing cells to the
     "combi-triazene" SMA41.
PG  - 11-20
AB  - PURPOSE: Previous studies have demonstrated enhanced potency associated
     with the binary [DNA/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)] targeting
     properties of SMA41 (a chimeric 3-(alkyl)-1,2,3-triazene linked to a
     4-anilinoquinazoline backbone) in the A431 (epidermal carcinoma of the
     vulva) cell line. We now report on the dependence of its antiproliferative
     effects (e.g. DNA damage, cell survival) on the EGFR and the DNA repair
     protein O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) contents of 12 solid
     tumor cell lines, two of which, NIH3T3 and NIH3T3 HER14 (engineered to
     overexpress EGFR), were isogenic. METHODS: Receptor type specificity was
     determined using ELISA for competitive binding, as well as growth
     factor-stimulation assays. DNA damage was studied using single-cell
     microelectrophoresis (comet) assays, and levels of EGFR were determined by
     Western blotting. The effects of SMA41 on the cell cycle of NIH3T3 cells
     were investigated using univariate flow cytometry. RESULTS: Studies of
     receptor type specificity showed that SMA41: (a) preferentially inhibited
     the kinase activity of EGFR over those of Src, insulin receptor and
     protein kinase C (PKC, a serine/threonine kinase), (b) induced stronger
     inhibition of growth stimulated with EGF than of growth stimulated with
     platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or fetal bovine serum (FBS). Despite
     the EGFR specificity of SMA41, there was an absence of a linear
     correlation between the EGFR status of our solid tumor cell lines and
     levels of DNA damage induced by the alkylating component. Similarly, EGFR
     levels did not correlate with IC(50) values. The antiproliferative
     activities of SMA41 correlated more with the AGT status of these cells and
     paralleled those of the clinical triazene temozolomide (TEM). However,
     throughout the panel, tumor cell sensitivity to SMA41 was consistently
     stronger than to its closest analogue TEM. Experiments performed with the
     isogenic cells showed that SMA41 was capable of inducing twofold higher
     levels of DNA damage in the EGFR transfectant and delayed cell entry to
     G(2)/M in both cell types. When the cells were starved and
     growth-stimulated with FBS (conditions under which both cell types were
     growth-stimulated), in contrast to TEM, SMA41 and its hydrolytic
     metabolite SMA52 exhibited approximately nine- and threefold stronger
     inhibition of growth of the EGFR transfectant. CONCLUSIONS: These results
     suggest that, in addition to its ability to induce DNA damage and cell
     cycle perturbations, SMA41 is capable of selectively targeting the cells
     with a growth advantage conferred by EGFR transfection. When compared with
     the monoalkyltriazene prodrug TEM, its potency may be further enhanced by
     its ability to hydrolyze to another signal transduction inhibitor (SMA52)
     plus a DNA alkylating agent that may further contribute to
     chemosensitivity. Thus, our new "combi-targeting" strategy may well
     represent a tandem approach to selectively blocking receptor tyrosine
     kinase-mediated growth signaling while inducing significant levels of
     cytotoxic DNA lesions in refractory tumors.

     antigen-induced primitive neuroectodermal tumors--medulloblastomas.
PG  - 138-47
AB  - Medulloblastomas represent about 25% of all pediatric intracranial
     neoplasms. These highly malignant tumors arise from the cerebellum,
     affecting mainly children between ages 5 and 15. Although the etiology of
     medulloblastomas has not yet been elucidated, several reports suggest that
     both the cellular protein insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and the
     early protein of the human polyomavirus JC (JCV T antigen) may contribute
     to the development of these tumors. The results of this study show a
     potential functional cooperation between these two proteins in the process
     of malignant transformation. Both medulloblastoma cell lines and
     medulloblastoma biopsies are characterized by the abundant presence of the
     IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and its major signaling molecule, insulin receptor
     substrate 1 (IRS-1). Importantly, IRS-1 is translocated to the nucleus in
     the presence of the JCV T antigen. Nuclear IRS-1 was detected in T
     antigen-positive cell lines and in T antigen-positive biopsies from
     patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma. The IRS-1 domain responsible for
     a direct JCV T antigen binding was localized within the N-terminal portion
     of IRS-1 molecule and the competition for IRS-1 T antigen binding by a
     dominant-negative mutant of IRS-1 inhibited growth and survival of JCV T
     antigen-transformed cells in anchorage-independent culture condition.

PG  - 2764-79
AB  - Insulin stimulates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5
     (Stat5) activation in insulin receptor (IR)-overexpressing cell lines and
     in insulin target tissues of mice. Stat5b and insulin receptor substrate 1
     (IRS-1) interact with the same autophosphorylation site in the IR
     [phosphotyrosine (pY) 972] in yeast two-hybrid assays, and the IR
     phosphorylates Stat5b in vitro. These data suggest that Stat5 proteins
     might be recruited to, and phosphorylated by, the activated IR in vivo.
     Nevertheless, insulin activates Janus kinases (JAKs) in IR-overexpressing
     cell lines and in insulin target tissues. To determine whether Stat5
     proteins must be recruited to the pY972LSA motif in the IR for
     insulin-stimulated activation in mammalian cells, we generated and tested
     a series of IR mutants. The L973R/A975D mutation abolishes the ability of
     the IR to induce Stat5 activation, whereas IRS-1 phosphorylation is
     unaffected. In contrast, the N969A/P970A mutation in the IR has no effect
     on Stat5 activation but significantly reduces IRS-1 phosphorylation. In
     coimmunoprecipitation assays, insulin-stimulated Stat5 activation
     correlates with Stat5 recruitment to the IR. We also find that insulin
     stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs that are constitutively
     associated with the IR. Expression of dominant-negative (DN) JAKs, the JAK
     inhibitor suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, or pretreatment with the JAK
     inhibitor, AG490, reduces, but does not eliminate, insulin-induced Stat5
     activation. Expression of the appropriate pair of DN JAKs in each of the
     singly JAK-deficient cell lines further establishes a component of
     insulin-stimulated Stat5 activation that is JAK independent. This likely
     represents phosphorylation of Stat5 proteins by the IR, as we find that IR
     kinase domain phosphorylates Stat5b in vitro on Y699 as efficiently as
     JAK2. Increasing the concentration of Stat5 proteins in cells favors the
     direct phosphorylation of Stat5 by the IR kinase where the DN-JAK
     inhibition of insulin-stimulated Stat5 activation becomes insignificant.
     At physiological levels of Stat5 however, we propose that JAKs and the IR
     both contribute to the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Stat5.

TI  - In IGF-I receptor-deficient leiomyosarcoma cells autocrine IGF-II induces
     cell invasion and protection from apoptosis via the insulin receptor
     isoform A.
PG  - 8240-50
AB  - One of the two isoforms of the human insulin receptor (isoform A or IR-A)
     binds IGF-II with high affinity and is predominantly expressed in fetal
     tissues and malignant cells. We evaluated the biological relevance of IR-A
     in human myosarcoma cells. Six myosarcoma cell lines were studied. All
     produced high amounts of IGF-II and five of them predominantly expressed
     IR-A. SKUT-1 leiomyosarcoma cells, that do not express the IGF-IR, were
     identified as a suitable model to study the effects of IR-A in the absence
     of the interference of IGF-IR. In these cells, which express high levels
     of IR with an IR-A relative abundance of approximately 95%, IGF-II elicits
     biological effects exclusively via IR-A activation and IGF-I is almost
     ineffective. Blockade of autocrine IGF-II reduced unstimulated cell
     viability and migration. Although both insulin and IGF-II activate IR-A,
     these two ligands showed a different ability to activate different
     intracellular signaling pathways and to elicit different biological
     effects. Insulin was more potent than IGF-II in activating the PI3-K/Akt
     pathway and in protecting cells from apoptosis. In contrast, IGF-II was
     more potent than insulin in activating the Shc/ERK pathway and in
     stimulating cell migration. These data indicate that IGF-II sensitive IR-A
     is the predominant IR isoform in a variety of myosarcoma cells. In SKUT-1
     leiomyoma cells this fetal IR isoform may vicariate the IGF-IR for cell

     IGF-II is more potent than insulin in stimulating cancer cell migration.

TI  - Secretion of Annexin II via activation of insulin receptor and

PG  - 4205-15
AB  - Annexin II is secreted into the extracellular environment, where, via
     interactions with specific proteases and extracellular matrix proteins, it
     participates in plasminogen activation, cell adhesion, and tumor
     metastasis and invasion. However, mechanisms regulating annexin II
     transport across the cellular membrane are unknown. In this study, we used
     coimmunoprecipitation to show that Annexin-II was bound to insulin and
     insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptors in PC12 cells and NIH-3T3
     cells overexpressing insulin (NIH-3T3(IR)) or IGF-1 receptor
     (NIH-3T3(IGF-1R)). Stimulation of insulin and IGF-1 receptors by insulin
     caused a temporary dissociation of annexin II from these receptors, which
     was accompanied by an increased amount of extracellular annexin II
     detected in the media of PC12, NIH-3T3(IR), and NIH-3T3(IGF-1R) cells but
     not in that of untransfected NIH-3T3 cells. Activation of a different
     growth factor receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, did
     not produce such results. Tyrphostin AG1024, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor
     of insulin and IGF-1 receptor, was shown to inhibit annexin II secretion
     along with reduced receptor phosphorylation. Inhibitors of a few
     downstream signaling enzymes including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,
     pp60c-Src, and protein kinase C had no effect on insulin-induced annexin
     II secretion, suggesting a possible direct link between receptor
     activation and annexin II secretion. Immunocytochemistry revealed that
     insulin also induced transport of the membrane-bound form of annexin II to
     the outside layer of the cell membrane and appeared to promote cell
     aggregation. These results suggest that the insulin receptor and its
     signaling pathways may participate in molecular mechanisms mediating
     annexin II secretion.

AB  - Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of insulin,
     insulin-like growth factors, and cytokine signaling and plays an important
     role in mediating apoptosis, cell differentiation, and cell
     transformation. We found that IRS-1 is constitutively activated in a
     variety of solid tumors, including breast cancers, leiomyomas, Wilms'
     tumors, rhabdomyosarcomas, liposarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, and adrenal
     cortical carcinomas. Blocking the constitutively activated IRS-1 signaling
     in breast cancer cells with a dominant-negative IRS-1, an IRS-1 with all
     18 potential tyrosine-phosphorylation sites replaced by phenylalanines
     (F18), dramatically reduced cancer cell growth. Breast cancer cells that
     expressed F18 also formed smaller and far fewer colonies in soft agar
     culture than did the cells that did not express F18. These studies suggest
     that constitutive IRS-1 activation is a common phenomenon in tumors and
     that activated IRS-1 may present an attractive therapeutic target.

TI  - Molecular changes associated with the acquisition of oestrogen
     hypersensitivity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells on long-term oestrogen
     deprivation.
PG  - 333-41
AB  - The growth dependence of many breast cancers on oestrogen has been
     exploited therapeutically by oestrogen deprivation, but almost all
     patients eventually develop resistance largely by unknown mechanisms.
     Wild-type (WT) MCF-7 cells were cultured in oestrogen-deficient medium for
     90 weeks in order to establish a long-term oestrogen-deprived MCF-7 (LTED)
     which eventually became independent of exogenous oestrogen for growth.
     After 15 weeks of quiescence (LTED-Q), basal growth rate increased in
     parallel with increasing oestrogen sensitivity. While 10(-9)M oestradiol
     (E2) maximally stimulated WT growth, the hypersensitive LTED (LTED-H) were
     maximally growth stimulated by 10(-13)M E2. By week 50, hypersensitivity
     was apparently lost and the cells became oestrogen independent (LTED-I),
     although the pure antioestrogen ICI182780 still inhibited cell growth and
     reversed the inhibitory effect of 10(-9)M E2 at 10(-12) to 10(-7)M.
     Tamoxifen (10(-7) to 10(-6)M) had a partial agonist effect on WT, but had
     no stimulatory effect on LTED. Whilst LTED cells have a low progesterone
     receptor (PgR) expression in all phases, oestrogen receptor (ER) a
     expression was, on average, elevated five- and seven-fold in LTED-H and
     LTED-I, respectively, and serine118 was phosphorylated. ERbeta expression
     was up-regulated and the levels of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)
     remained low throughout all phases. The levels of RIP140mRNA appeared to
     decrease to approximately 50% of the WT message in LTED-Q and remained
     constant into the hypersensitive phase. No significant changes were
     observed in the expression of SUG-1, TIF-1 and SMRT in LTED. The overall
     changes in nuclear receptor interacting proteins do not appear to be
     involved in the hypersensitivity. Thus, the resistance of these human
     breast cancer cells to oestrogen-deprivation appears to be due to acquired
     hypersensitivity which may be explained in part by increased levels of and
     phosphorylated ERalpha.

TI  - Protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPL1/FAP-1 triggers apoptosis in human
     breast cancer cells.
PG  - 47861-9
AB  - Studies in Jurkat leukemia cells have suggested that protein-tyrosine
     phosphatase PTPL1/FAP-1 rescues Fas-induced cell death. However, we have
     previously shown that this enzyme triggers 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced
     growth inhibition in human breast cancer cells. The present study
     addresses the role of PTPL1/FAP-1 in antiestrogen-regulated apoptotic
     effect and insulin-like growth factor-I survival action in MCF7 cells and
     further identifies the impacted signaling pathway. By terminal
     deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling and
     cytoplasmic nucleosome enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we demonstrated
     that 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced apoptosis was totally lost in PTPL1/FAP-1
     antisense transfectants in which enzyme expression was abrogated,
     revealing the crucial role of this phosphatase in the apoptotic process in
     human breast cancer cells. Time-dependent expression of PTPL1/FAP-1 in
     MCF7 cells completely abolished the survival action of insulin-like growth
     factor-I. This effect occurred through a highly significant reduction in
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway activation (80% reduction in
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, 55% inhibition of Akt activation)
     accompanied by a 65% decrease in insulin receptor substrate-1 growth
     factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. These results provide the first
     evidence that PTPL1/FAP-1 has a key role in the apoptotic process in human
     breast cancer cells independent of Fas but associated with an early
     inhibition of the insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphatidylinositol
     3-kinase pathway. Our data therefore suggest new therapeutic routes and
     strengthen the importance of identifying endogenous regulators and
     substrates of this phosphatase in breast tumors.

AB  - In addition to neuroendocrine abnormalities, women with polycystic ovary
     syndrome have insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction associated with
     a high frequency of metabolic syndrome components, such as glucose
     intolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2), dyslipidemia and a higher
     risk for endothelial dysfunction, haemostatic abnormalities, hypertension
     and cardiovascular disease. Obesity, a common finding in this disorder,
     plays an important role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular
     disorders. Early identification of patients and prompt initiation of
     insulin sensitizing therapy by pharmacological agents or changes in life
     style such diet and exercise might improve the metabolic and endocrine
     abnormalities and reduce the risk of DM-2 and cardiovascular disease in
     these patients.

TI  - Decreased insulin receptor (IR) autophosphorylation in fibroblasts from
     patients with PCOS: effects of serine kinase inhibitors and IR activators.
PG  - 4088-93
AB  - Insulin resistance is characteristic of many patients with polycystic
     ovary syndrome (PCOS). Several studies have suggested that a decrease in
     insulin receptor (IR) autophosphorylation is a significant component of
     this resistance. In this study, we have used a highly sensitive ELISA to
     measure IR tyrosine phosphorylation in fibroblasts from patients with PCOS
     and healthy control women. After the stimulation of intact fibroblasts
     with insulin, IR tyrosine phosphorylation in cells from the PCOS patients
     was decreased by approximately 40% when compared with controls. However,
     when IR were first immunocaptured from fibroblasts and then stimulated
     with insulin, neither basal nor insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation
     was different between the two groups, suggesting that a factor independent
     of the IR was involved. To examine the role of increased serine kinase
     activity in decreased IR autophosphorylation in PCOS, fibroblasts from
     PCOS patients were pretreated with inhibitors of serine kinases before
     insulin stimulation. Pretreatment with H7, a nonspecific protein kinase
     inhibitor, completely reversed the decrease in insulin-stimulated IR
     autophosphorylation. Pretreatment with H89, an inhibitor of protein kinase
     A, partially reversed this function, whereas pretreatment with Go6983, an
     inhibitor of protein kinase C, was without effect. We next studied the
     effects of two small molecule activators of the IR tyrosine kinase:
     TLK16998 and Merck L7. Both TLK16998 and Merck L7 were able to reverse the
     impaired insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation. In summary, a
     factor(s) extrinsic to the IR cause impaired IR signaling in fibroblasts
     from patients with PCOS. Reversal of the impaired IR signaling by
     inhibitors of serine kinase activity suggests that serine kinase-mediated
     pathways may be involved in the insulin resistance. Moreover, the
     observation that TLK16998 and Merck L7 improved IR tyrosine

PG  - 43565-71
AB  - In type 2 diabetes mellitus, impaired insulin signaling leads to
     hyperglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities. TLK19780, a non-peptide
     small molecule, is a new member of a novel class of anti-diabetic agents
     that function as activators of the insulin receptor (IR) beta-subunit
     tyrosine kinase. In HTC-IR cells, 20 microm TLK19780 enhanced maximal
     insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation 2-fold and increased insulin
     sensitivity 2-3-fold. In contrast, TLK19780 did not potentiate the action
     of insulin-like growth factor-1, indicating the selectivity of TLK19780
     toward the IR. The predominant effect of TLK19780 was to increase the
     number of IR that underwent autophosphorylation. Kinetic studies indicated
     that TLK19780 acted very rapidly, with a maximal effect observed 2 min
     after addition to insulin-stimulated cells. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, 5 microm
     TLK19780 enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose transport, increasing both
     the sensitivity and maximal responsiveness to insulin. These studies
     indicate that at low micromolar levels small IR activator molecules can
     enhance insulin action in various cultured cells and suggest that this
     effect is mediated by increasing the number of IR that are
     tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin. These studies suggest that
     these types of molecules could be developed to treat type 2 diabetes and
     other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance.

     implications for IGF-II mitogenic signaling.
PG  - 3259-67
AB  - The insulin receptor mediates a proliferative response in certain
     transformed cells, but little is known about its function in ovarian
     cancer. We used human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines and
     lifespan-extended normal ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells to examine
     (125)I-insulin binding and mitogenic responses to insulin. All cancer cell
     and OSE cultures specifically bound (125)I-insulin. Except for OV202, the
     carcinoma lines had elevated insulin binding compared with OSE cells. All
     carcinoma lines except OV202 expressed insulin receptor as detected by
     flow cytometry and increased (3)H-thymidine incorporation or cell number
     in response to 0.1-10 nM insulin. Interestingly, similar concentrations of
     IGF-II also induced proliferation of the insulin-responsive cancer cell
     lines and displaced (125)I-insulin binding. Direct binding of
     (125)I-IGF-II to the insulin receptor was visualized by cross-linking and
     immunoprecipitation. Binding of IGF-II to the insulin receptor and a
     proliferative effect of insulin suggest the presence of insulin receptor
     isoform A. Real-time PCR analyses confirm that insulin receptor isoform A
     expression predominates over isoform B expression in the ovarian carcinoma
     cell lines. This report suggests that the insulin receptor may play a role
     in the regulation of ovarian cancer cell growth.

TI  - Proinflammatory cytokines block growth of breast cancer cells by impairing
     signals from a growth factor receptor.
PG  - 4746-56
AB  - Neutralization of endogenous growth factors and administration of
     exogenous bioactive cytokines are two distinct biological antitumor
     strategies that show promise for treatment of cancer patients. In this
     report, we provide evidence to link both strategies as an integrative
     approach to cancer therapy. We tested the hypothesis that proinflammatory
     cytokines block growth of transformed cells by inhibiting key
     intracellular signaling events after activation of the insulin-like growth
     factor-I (IGF-I) tyrosine kinase receptor. IGF-I stimulates DNA synthesis
     in MCF-7 cells by 15-fold. This increase is significantly inhibited by TNF
     (tumor necrosis factor) -alpha at 0.1 ng/ml and is reduced by 80% at 100
     ng/ml. Similarly, both IL (interleukin) -1beta and IL-6 significantly
     reduce the ability of IGF-I to promote DNA synthesis. Flow cytometry
     confirmed that all three of the cytokines inhibit IGF-I-induced DNA
     synthesis by preventing cells from entering the S phase of the cell cycle,
     leading to G(0)/G(1) arrest. Although none of the cytokines alone are
     cytotoxic to transformed epithelial cells in the absence of serum,
     TNF-alpha significantly inhibits the antiapoptotic property of IGF-I in
     protecting MCF-7 cells from DNA fragmentation. TNF-alpha and IL-1beta act
     by inhibiting the IGF-I receptor from tyrosine phosphorylating insulin
     receptor substrate-1 without affecting tyrosine kinase activity of the
     IGF-IR itself. These data support the novel idea that the major inhibitory
     properties of proinflammatory cytokines on growth of breast cancer cells
     are manifested prominently in the presence of growth factors. These data
     also highlight growth factor receptor adaptor molecules, such as insulin
     receptor substrate-1, rather than the receptors themselves as targets for
     antitumor therapeutic strategies.

TI  - ETV6-NTRK3 transformation requires insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor
     signaling and is associated with constitutive IRS-1 tyrosine
     phosphorylation.
PG  - 5684-95
AB  - Congenital fibrosarcoma (CFS) and cellular mesoblastic nephroma (CMN) are
     pediatric spindle cell malignancies that share two specific cytogenetic
     abnormalities: trisomy of chromosome 11 and a t(12;15)(p13;q25)
     translocation. The t(12;15) rearrangement creates a transcriptionally
     active fusion gene that encodes a chimeric oncoprotein, ETV6-NTRK3 (EN).
     EN transforms NIH3T3 fibroblasts through constitutive activation of both
     the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the
     phosphatidylinositol-3'kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. However, the role of
     trisomy 11 in CFS and CMN remains unknown. In this study we demonstrate
     elevated expression of the chromosome 11p15.5 insulin-like growth factor 2
     gene (IGF2) in CFS and CMN tumors. Moreover, we present evidence that an
     intact IGF signaling axis is essential for in vitro EN-mediated
     transformation. EN only very weakly transformed so-called R-murine
     fibroblasts derived from mice with a targeted disruption of the IGF1
     receptor gene (IGFRI), but transformation activity was fully restored in
     R- cells engineered to re-express IGFRI (R+ cells). We also observed that
     the major IGFRI substrate, insulin-receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), was
     constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and could be co-immunoprecipitated
     with EN in either R- or R+ cells expressing the EN oncoprotein. IRS-1
     association with Grb2 and PI3K p85, which link IGFRI to the Ras-MAPK and
     PI3K-Akt pathways, respectively, was enhanced in both cell types in the
     presence of EN. However, activation of the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways
     was markedly attenuated in EN-expressing R- cells compared to
     EN-transformed R+ cells. This suggests that IRS-1 may be functioning as an
     adaptor in EN signal transduction, but that a link to EN transformation
     pathways requires the presence of IGFRI. Our findings indicate that an
     intact IGF signaling axis is essential for EN transformation, and are
     consistent with a role for trisomy 11 in augmenting this pathway in EN
     expressing tumors.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) inhibits breast
     cancer cell motility.
PG  - 4369-75
AB  - The breast cancer malignant phenotype is regulated by steroid hormones and
     peptide growth factors. We have shown previously that insulin-like growth
     factor-I (IGF-I) stimulates cell motility in a metastatic cell line,
     MDA-231BO. In this study, we show that neutralization of IGF action by a
     type I IGF receptor (IGFR1) blocking antibody or neutralization of IGF-I
     by IGFBP-1 reduced cell motility. However, in addition to inhibiting IGF
     effects, IGFBP-1 also diminished basal motility. Because IGFBP-1 contains
     a RGD motif important in binding of fibronectin to its alpha 5 beta 1
     integrin receptor, we examined the effect of inhibiting integrin function
     on cell motility. As expected, disruption of fibronectin-integrin
     interactions interrupted basal motility in MDA-231BO cells. In addition,
     disruption of integrin function by an alpha 5 beta 1 blocking peptide also
     inhibited IGF stimulation of cell motility. To determine whether integrin
     function could interfere with IGF signaling, we used an alpha 5 beta 1
     blocking peptide to show that in MDA-231BO cells integrin occupancy
     appeared necessary for phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-2 but
     not for IGFR1 activation. We conclude that IGFR1 and integrin action are
     linked in these breast cancer cells as disruption of integrin binding to
     its receptor influences IGF signaling pathways. Moreover, IGFBP-1 could
     have dual effects on cancer cell motility by disrupting both receptor
     systems.

TI  - Dichloroacetate stimulates glycogen accumulation in primary hepatocytes
     through an insulin-independent mechanism.
PG  - 508-15
AB  - Dichloroacetate (DCA), a by-product of water chlorination, causes liver
     cancer in B6C3F1 mice. A hallmark response observed in mice exposed to
     carcinogenic doses of DCA is an accumulation of hepatic glycogen content.
     To distinguish whether the in vivo glycogenic effect of DCA was dependent
     on insulin and insulin signaling proteins, experiments were conducted in
     isolated hepatocytes where insulin concentrations could be controlled. In
     hepatocytes isolated from male B6C3F1 mice, DCA increased glycogen levels
     in a dose-related manner, independently of insulin. The accumulation of
     hepatocellular glycogen induced by DCA was not the result of decreased
     glycogenolysis, since DCA had no effect on the rate of glucagon-stimulated
     glycogen breakdown. Glycogen accumulation caused by DCA treatment was not
     hindered by inhibitors of extracellular-regulated protein kinase kinase
     (Erk1/2 kinase or MEK) or p70 kDa S6 protein kinase (p70(S6K)), but was
     completely blocked by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors,
     LY294002 and wortmannin. Similarly, insulin-stimulated glycogen deposition
     was not influenced by the Erk1/2 kinase inhibitor, PD098509, or the
     p70(S6K) inhibitor, rapamycin. Unlike DCA-stimulated glycogen deposition,
     PI3K-inhibition only partially blocked the glycogenic effect of insulin.
     DCA did not cause phosphorylation of the downstream PI3K target protein,
     protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). The phosphorylation of PKB/Akt did not
     correlate to insulin-stimulated glycogenesis either. Similar to insulin,
     DCA in the medium decreased IR expression in isolated hepatocytes. The
     results indicate DCA increases hepatocellular glycogen accumulation
     through a PI3K-dependent mechanism that does not involve PKB/Akt and is,
     at least in part, different from the classical insulin-stimulated
     glycogenesis pathway. Somewhat surprisingly, insulin-stimulated
     glycogenesis also appears not to involve PKB/Akt in isolated murine
     hepatocytes.

TI  - Antiestrogen ICI 182,780 decreases proliferation of insulin-like growth
     factor I (IGF-I)-treated MCF-7 cells without inhibiting IGF-I signaling.
PG  - 3985-91
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that antiestrogens inhibit MCF-7 cell
     proliferation by alteringthe expression or activity of components of the
     insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signaling pathway, including IGF-I
     receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
     In this report, we examine the effects of the pure antiestrogen ICI
     182,780 (ICI) on various targets of IGF-I signaling in MCF-7 cells. ICI
     treatment led to decreases in the absolute levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin
     A expression, retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, and DNA synthesis in
     IGF-I-treated cells. However, IGF-I retained the ability to induce these
     events in the presence of ICI, suggesting that ICI treatment did not
     completely block IGF-I signaling. Consistent with this suggestion,
     IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase,
     AKT, and insulin receptor substrate 1 was unaffected by ICI treatment.
     Finally, transient expression of either constitutively active
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or AKT was unable to induce proliferation in
     ICI-treated MCF-7 cells. Together, these results indicate that ICI can
     inhibit proliferation without blocking IGF-I signaling and suggest a model
     in which both estrogen receptor and IGF-I signaling regulate cell cycle
     components and are required for MCF-7 cell proliferation.

     glucose production.
PG  - 34933-40
AB  - Herbs have been used for medicinal purposes, including the treatment of
     diabetes, for centuries. Plants containing flavonoids are used to treat
     diabetes in Indian medicine and the green tea flavonoid, epigallocatechin
     gallate (EGCG), is reported to have glucose-lowering effects in animals.
     We show here that the regulation of hepatic glucose production is
     decreased by EGCG. Furthermore, like insulin, EGCG increases tyrosine
     phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1
     (IRS-1), and it reduces phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression
     in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent manner. EGCG also mimics insulin
     by increasing phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase,
     and p70(s6k) activity. EGCG differs from insulin, however, in that it
     affects several insulin-activated kinases with slower kinetics.
     Furthermore, EGCG regulates genes that encode gluconeogenic enzymes and
     protein-tyrosine phosphorylation by modulating the redox state of the
     cell. These results demonstrate that changes in the redox state may have
     beneficial effects for the treatment of diabetes and suggest a potential
     role for EGCG, or derivatives, as an antidiabetic agent.

TI  - Sam68 associates with the SH3 domains of Grb2 recruiting GAP to the
     Grb2-SOS complex in insulin receptor signaling.
PG  - 99-106
AB  - The 68 kDa Src substrate associated during mitosis (Sam68) is an RNA
     binding protein with Src homology (SH) 2 and 3 domain binding sites. We
     have recently found that Sam68 is a substrate of the insulin receptor (IR)
     that translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and that
     Tyr-phosphorylated Sam68 associates with the SH2 domains of p85 PI3K and
     GAP, in vivo and in vitro. In the present work, we have further
     demonstrated the cytoplasmic localization of Sam68, which is increased in
     cells overexpressing IR. Besides, we sought to further study the
     association of Sam68 with the Ras-GAP pathway by assessing the
     interactions with SH3 domains of Grb2. We employed GST-fusion proteins
     containing the SH3 domains of Grb2 (N or C), and recombinant Sam68 for in
     vitro studies. In vivo studies of protein-protein interaction were
     assessed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments with specific antibodies
     against Sam68, GAP, Grb2, SOS, and phosphotyrosine; and by affinity
     precipitation with the fusion proteins (SH3-Grb2). Insulin stimulation of
     HTC-IR cells promotes phosphorylation of Sam68 and its association with
     the SH2 domains of GAP. Sam68 is constitutively associated with the SH3
     domains of Grb2 and it does not change upon insulin stimulation, but Sam68
     is Tyr-phosphorylated and promotes the association of GAP with the
     Grb2-SOS complex. In vitro studies with fusion proteins showed that Sam68
     association with Grb2 is preferentially mediated by the C-terminal SH3
     domains of Grb2. In conclusion, Sam68 is a substrate of the IR and may
     have a role as a docking protein in IR signaling, recruiting GAP to the
     Grb2-SOS complex, and in this way it may modulate Ras activity.

AB  - PCOS is the most frequent endocrine disorder of premenopausal women. The
     common clinical signs of PCOS are hirsutism, menstrual irregularities with
     chronic anovulation and a trend toward overweight or obesity. Diagnosis is
     based upon high plasma levels of androgens and the ultrasound image of
     polycystic ovaries. The high prevalence of PCOS at first degree female
     relatives suggest an important genetic component of this syndrome. Linking
     studies in sisters presenting phenotypical traits of PCOS and in their
     parents allowed the investigation of certain candidate genes presumed to
     be involved in the physiopathology of PCOS. The genes encoding enzymes
     involved in androgen synthesis, protein transducers of insulin signals and
     the paracrine regulating factors of gonadotrophins and ovarian function
     have been analysed. To date, no determinant gene mutation was reported.
     However, several loci were detected, especially a locus within the insulin
     receptor. Mutations or gene polymorphisms and their function remain to be
     identified. These research attempts should explain the physiopathology of
     PCOS and open new therapeutic perspectives. The usage of medication
     increasing the sensitivity to insulin action is an example of applying
     these particular aspects.

TI  - STAT6 mediates interleukin-4 growth inhibition in human breast cancer
     cells.
PG  - 324-31
AB  - In addition to acting as a hematopoietic growth factor, interleukin-4
     (IL-4) inhibits growth of some transformed cells in vitro and in vivo. In
     this study, we show that insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, IRS-2, and
     signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) are
     phosphorylated following IL-4 treatment in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
     STAT6 DNA binding is enhanced by IL-4 treatment. STAT6 activation occurs
     even after IRS-1 depletion, suggesting the two pathways are independent.
     To examine the role of STAT6 in IL-4-mediated growth inhibition and
     apoptosis, a full-length STAT6 cDNA was transfected into MCF-7 cells.
     Transient overexpression of STAT6 resulted in both cytoplasmic and nuclear
     expression of the protein, increased DNA binding in response to IL-4, and
     increased transactivation of an IL-4 responsive promoter. In
     STAT6-transfected cells, basal proliferation was reduced whereas apoptosis
     was increased. Finally, stable expression of STAT6 resulted in reduced
     foci formation compared to vector-transfected cells alone. These results
     suggest STAT6 is required for IL-4-mediated growth inhibition and
     induction of apoptosis in human breast cancer cells.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor I receptor activity in human medulloblastomas.
PG  - 1822-30
AB  - Medulloblastomas represent about 25% of all pediatric intracranial
     neoplasms. These highly malignant tumors arise from the cerebellum
     affecting mainly children between ages 5 and 15. Although the etiology of
     medulloblastomas has not yet been elucidated, several reports suggest that
     insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) may contribute to the development of
     these tumors. Results of this study show that the majority of cases
     examined were characterized by the abundant presence of the receptor for
     IGF-I (IGF-IR) protein (16 of 20 cases), and its major signaling molecule,
     insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1; 15 of 20). Protein levels for IGF-IR
     and IRS-1, determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, were
     significantly higher in medulloblastoma biopsies than in control
     cerebellar tissue. By immunohistochemistry, 10 of 17 biopsies examined
     were also positive for the anti-pY1316 antibody staining that specifically
     recognizes the phosphorylated (active) form of the IGF-IR. These findings
     correlate with the fact that phosphorylated forms of the
     downstream-signaling molecules Erk-1, Erk-2, and Akt/protein kinase B were
     found in medulloblastoma biopsies but not in control cerebellar tissue.
     Importantly, there is a strong inverse correlation between biopsies that
     are positive for anti-pY1316 and for anti-Trk-C immunoreactivity. These
     observations direct our attention to the IGF-IR system as a potential
     therapeutic target in medulloblastomas and suggest a possibility of using
     the anti-pY1316 antibody as a potential prognostic marker for
     medulloblastomas.

     is independent of cell adhesion molecules in HT29-D4 colon carcinoma
     cells-evidence for a NF-kappaB-dependent survival mechanism.
PG  - 768-79
AB  - We have previously established that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I,
     -II and insulin exert a strong protective effect against tumor necrosis
     factor-alpha (TNF)-induced apoptosis in interferon-gamma (IFN)-sensitized
     HT29-D4 human colon carcinoma cells. In this study, we report that this
     effect was still operative when cells were cultured in the absence of
     integrin- and E-cadherin-mediated cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell
     interactions. In this model, IGF-I did not activate the focal adhesion
     kinase, whereas it induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin
     receptor substrate-1 and activation of the extracellular signal-related
     kinase 1 and 2, p38, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and protein kinase
     B/Akt. However, the use of specific inhibitors indicated that these
     pathways did not play a role in the adhesion-independent IGF-I
     anti-apoptotic signal. In contrast, inhibition of the NF-kappaB activation
     induced a complete reversal of the IGF-I anchorage-independent protective
     effect. Correspondingly, IGF-I markedly enhanced the TNF- and
     IFN/TNF-induced NF-kappaB-dependent interleukin-8 production. Our results
     provide evidence that IGF-I induces resistance against cytokine-induced
     cell death even in the absence of cell adhesion-mediated signaling.
     NF-kappaB appears to be a key mediator of this anti-apoptotic effect that
     should contribute to the resistance of colon cancer cells to
     immune-destruction during metastasis.

     death.
PG  - 6215-23
AB  - The insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family of signaling molecules is
     expressed in lymphocytes, although their functions in these cells is
     largely unknown. To investigate the role of IRS in the protection of T
     cells from activation-induced cell death (AICD), we transfected the T cell
     hybridoma A1.1, which is IL-4 responsive but lacks expression of IRS
     family members with cDNA encoding IRS1 or IRS2. Stimulation of these
     clones with immobilized anti-CD3-induced expression of CD69 to the same
     level as the parental A1.1 cells. However, the A1.1 IRS1-expressing cells
     were markedly resistant to AICD, while the A1.1 IRS2-expressing cells were
     not. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase in the A1.1
     IRS1-expressing cells did not abrogate their resistance to AICD. Fas mRNA
     was induced similarly by anti-CD3 in A1.1, A1.1 IRS1-expressing, and A1.1
     IRS2-expressing cells. However, induction of Fas ligand (FasL) mRNA and
     functional FasL protein was delayed and decreased in IRS1-expressing
     cells, but not in IRS2-expressing cells. The induction of transcription
     from a 500-bp FasL promoter and a minimal 16-mer early growth response
     element linked to luciferase was also impaired in the IRS1-expressing
     cells. These results suggest that overexpression of IRS1, but not IRS2,
     protects A1.1 cells from AICD by diminishing FasL transcription through a
     pathway that is independent of the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and
     phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity.

TI  - Upper abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and breast cancer risk.
PG  - 747-53
AB  - PURPOSE: A majority of prospective studies show breast cancer risk to be
     higher in obese postmenopausal women with upper abdominal adiposity than
     in those with overall adiposity. The evidence is more limited and
     inconsistent in the case of premenopausal women. The review examines
     evidence that aberrant insulin signalling may be involved in the promotion
     of mammary carcinogenesis. The aetiology and concomitants of abdominal
     visceral obesity are examined. MECHANISMS: Clinical and experimental
     evidence suggests that the higher breast cancer risk associated with
     greater abdominal visceral obesity may be related to aberrant insulin
     signalling through the insulin receptor substrate 1 pathway, leading to
     insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and increased concentrations of
     endogenous oestrogen and androgen. The putative role of aberrant insulin
     signalling in the promotion of mammary carcinogenesis may help to explain
     clinical relationships between breast cancer risk and age at menarche,
     pregnancies and onset of obesity. CONCLUSION: Overall adiposity in women
     adversely affects breast cancer risk mainly by greater exposure of mammary
     epithelial tissue to endogenous oestrogen. Upper abdominal adiposity
     appears to involve an additional effect related to the presence of insulin
     resistance. Aetiological factors in the development of hyperinsulinaemic
     insulin resistance are still uncertain but may involve aberrant
     susceptibility genes in adipocyte insulin receptors or in the insulin
     receptor substrate 1 pathway. Epigenetic factors are also likely to
     contribute, including high free fatty acid levels and obesity. Dietary
     fatty acids, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids, are known to
     regulate adipocyte differentiation through the nuclear peroxisome
     proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and may also have a role in insulin
     resistance. These aetiological factors are likely to be relevant to the
     high risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in industrialised Western
     populations.

TI  - Insulin receptor-mediated organ overgrowth in Drosophila is not restricted
     by body size.
PG  - 196-202
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that insulin receptor (Inr) signalling
     plays an important role in determining organ size and maintaining
     proportionality in normal animals. However, it is unclear whether the
     activity of this pathway in a developing organ is invariably a dominant
     determinant of its mass or whether size can be restricted by other
     non-autonomous growth regulatory mechanisms if a tissue starts to outgrow
     the rest of the body. To test this in Drosophila, we induced excess
     Inr-dependent growth by removal of the Inr signalling antagonist, DPTEN,
     in the eyes of flies with dramatically different body sizes. Although our
     data suggest a very limited level of growth competition between organs in
     animals with giant eyes, there do not appear to be mechanisms by which
     neighbouring structures substantially inhibit eye overgrowth, even when
     the resulting organ is many times enlarged relative to the rest of the
     animal. Overall, our results support a simple model in which organs are
     normally maintained in proportion to each other, primarily because they
     all respond similarly to levels of insulin-like factors and other growth
     regulators. Given the evolutionarily conserved role of insulin receptor
     signalling in growth control, our data may also help to explain why this
     pathway is so frequently hyperactivated in mammalian tumours.

TI  - Nitric oxide regulates oestrogen-activated signalling pathways at multiple
     levels through cyclic GMP-dependent recruitment of insulin receptor
     substrate 1.
PG  - 165-73
AB  - The gaseous messenger nitric oxide (NO) contributes to biological effects
     of oestrogen in target tissues, including reproductive organs, bone,
     cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Vasodilation and
     anti-atherosclerotic properties of NO have been shown to play a role in
     these effects. The possibility that NO acts also through regulation of the
     signal transduction cascade triggered by oestrogen, instead, has never
     been investigated. To study this we have used the MCF-7 human breast
     cancer cell line, an established model for oestrogen signalling. Exposure
     of these cells to 17-beta-oestradiol (E(2)) in the presence of NO gave
     rise to activation of signalling events additional to those triggered by
     E(2) alone, namely tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins,
     including the insulin receptor substrate-1, with recruitment to this
     adapter of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and persistent activation of
     Akt (protein kinase B). Active Akt, in turn, prevented E(2) from
     activating p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK 1/2). These
     effects of NO, which were mediated through generation of cyclic GMP and
     activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase I, initiated in the first
     minutes after administration of oestrogen. The consequences, however, were
     long lasting, as modulation of Akt and ERK 1/2 activities by NO was
     responsible for inhibition of E(2)-triggered cell growth and regulation of
     oestrogen responsive-element dependent gene transcription. Generation of
     NO is stimulated by both E(2) and growth factors known to contribute to
     the complex network of intracellular events regulating the biological
     actions of oestrogen. It is conceivable, therefore, that modulation by NO
     of E(2) early signalling, here described for the first time, has broad
     significance in regulating cellular responses to the hormone.

TI  - RACK1 is an insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor-interacting
     protein that can regulate IGF-1-mediated Akt activation and protection
     from cell death.
PG  - 22581-9
AB  - The insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R),
     activated by their ligands, control metabolism, cell survival, and
     proliferation. Although the signaling pathways activated by these
     receptors are well characterized, regulation of their activity is poorly
     understood. To identify regulatory proteins we undertook a two-hybrid
     screen using the IGF-1R beta-chain as bait. This screen identified
     Receptor for Activated C Kinases (RACK1) as an IGF-1R-interacting protein.
     RACK1 also interacted with the IGF-1R in fibroblasts and MCF-7 cells and
     with endogenous insulin receptor in COS cells. Interaction with the IGF-1R
     did not require tyrosine kinase activity or receptor autophosphorylation
     but did require serine 1248 in the C terminus. Overexpression of RACK1 in
     either R+ fibroblasts or MCF-7 cells inhibited IGF-1-induced
     phosphorylation of Akt, whereas it enhanced phosphorylation of Erks and
     Jnks. Src, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and SHP-2
     were all associated with RACK1 in these cells. Interestingly, the
     proliferation of MCF-7 cells was enhanced by overexpression of RACK1,
     whereas IGF-1-mediated protection from etoposide killing was greatly
     reduced. Altogether the data indicate that RACK1 is an IGF-1R-interacting
     protein that can modulate receptor signaling and suggest that RACK1 has a
     particular role in regulating Akt activation and cell survival.

TI  - RACK1, an insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor-interacting
     protein, modulates IGF-I-dependent integrin signaling and promotes cell
     spreading and contact with extracellular matrix.
PG  - 2345-65
AB  - The insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor (IGF-IR) is known to
     regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell proliferation,
     cell survival, cell differentiation, and cell transformation. IRS-1 and
     Shc, substrates of the IGF-IR, are known to mediate IGF-IR signaling
     pathways such as those of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which are believed to play important
     roles in some of the IGF-IR-dependent biological functions. We used the
     cytoplasmic domain of IGF-IR in a yeast two-hybrid interaction trap to
     identify IGF-IR-interacting molecules that may potentially mediate
     IGF-IR-regulated functions. We identified RACK1, a WD repeat family member
     and a Gbeta homologue, and demonstrated that RACK1 interacts with the
     IGF-IR but not with the closely related insulin receptor (IR). In several
     types of mammalian cells, RACK1 interacted with IGF-IR, protein kinase C,
     and beta1 integrin in response to IGF-I and phorbol 12-myristate
     13-acetate stimulation. Whereas most of RACK1 resides in the cytoskeletal
     compartment of the cytoplasm, transformation of fibroblasts and epithelial
     cells by v-Src, oncogenic IR or oncogenic IGF-IR, but not by Ros or Ras,
     resulted in a significantly increased association of RACK1 with the
     membrane. We examined the role of RACK1 in IGF-IR-mediated functions by
     stably overexpressing RACK1 in NIH 3T3 cells that expressed an elevated
     level of IGF-IR. RACK1 overexpression resulted in reduced IGF-I-induced
     cell growth in both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent
     conditions. Overexpression of RACK1 also led to enhanced cell spreading,
     increased stress fibers, and increased focal adhesions, which were
     accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase
     and paxillin. While IGF-I-induced activation of IRS-1, Shc, PI3K, and MAPK
     pathways was unaffected, IGF-I-inducible beta1 integrin-associated kinase
     activity and association of Crk with p130(CAS) were significantly
     inhibited by RACK1 overexpression. In RACK1-overexpressing cells, delayed
     cell cycle progression in G(1) or G(1)/S was correlated with
     retinoblastoma protein hypophophorylation, increased levels of
     p21(Cip1/WAF1) and p27(Kip1), and reduced IGF-I-inducible Cdk2 activity.
     Reduction of RACK1 protein expression by antisense oligonucleotides
     prevented cell spreading and suppressed IGF-I-dependent monolayer growth.
     Our data suggest that RACK1 is a novel IGF-IR signaling molecule that
     functions as a positive mediator of cell spreading and contact with
     extracellular matrix, possibly through a novel IGF-IR signaling pathway
     involving integrin and focal adhesion signaling molecules.

TI  - Aurintricarboxylic acid induces a distinct activation of the IGF-I
     receptor signaling within MDA-231 cells.
PG  - 837-45
AB  - Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), a polymeric carboxylated triphenylmethane
     derivate, prevents apoptotic death in a variety of cell systems. Recently,
     we have shown that the survival promoting effect of ATA is transduced via
     activation of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling pathway. In breast
     cancer MDA-231 cells exposed either to the protein synthesis inhibitors
     cycloheximide or ricin or to the anticancer drug adriamycin, we have found
     that ATA, but not IGF-1, is a powerful antiapoptotic agent. The purpose of
     this study was to compare the ability of ATA and IGF-I to activate the
     IGF-IR signaling cascade and to correlate this ability to their survival
     potency. MDA-231 cells were exposed to ATA or IGF-I, up to 7 h, and the
     dynamics of activation of the IGF-IR signaling cascade was evaluated. Our
     results show that: 1) The amount of tyrosine phosphorylated IGF-IR
     proteins was greater after exposure to ATA, compared with IGF-I. 2) Two
     phosphorylated IGF-IR beta-subunits (a 95-kDa and a 75-kDa) were induced
     after exposure to ATA, whereas IGF-1 induced only the 95-kDa form.
     Immunoprecipitation of both receptor forms by antibodies against the
     alpha-subunit and against the carboxy terminus of the beta-subunit of the
     IGF-IR suggests that the 75-kDa form could be the beta-chain truncated at
     the amino terminus above the alpha-beta disulphide bridges. 3) The
     ATA-activated IGF-IR forms underwent slow dephosphorylation, compared with
     a rapid dephosphorylation of the IGF-I activated receptor. 4) The insulin
     receptor substrate-1/2-associated PI3K, Shc proteins, and the kinases Akt
     and Erk1/2, downstream mediators of the antiapoptotic signaling by IGF-IR,
     were activated to a higher extent and for a longer time period by ATA,
     compared with IGF-I. Taken together, the sustained activation of the
     IGF-IR signaling pathway by ATA may explain its stronger antiapoptotic
     effect. We suggest that this enhanced activity, and the different
     susceptibility of the IGF-IR to certain proteases and phosphatases, may
     indicate a distinct conformation of the ATA-activated IGF-IR.

PG  - 151-66
AB  - There is extensive experimental evidence that sex steroids and insulin
     interact in their actions on tissues. At physiological levels,
     testosterone and oestradiol are thought to be involved in maintaining
     normal insulin sensitivity. However, outside this 'physiological window'
     these steroids may promote insulin resistance. Considerable research has
     been carried out on polycystic ovarian syndrome, a common disorder
     associated with excessive androgen production and insulin resistance.
     Hyperinsulinaemia in patients with this condition is believed to stimulate
     ovarian androgen production, and there is also evidence that androgens act
     directly on peripheral tissues to promote insulin resistance. There is the
     potential for a vicious circle to develop with increasing androgen
     production and insulin resistance. The molecular basis of this insulin
     resistance has been reported to involve reduced insulin receptor
     autophosphorylation, reduced expression and translocation of
     insulin-responsive glucose transporters and defects of the insulin
     signalling pathway distal to the insulin receptor. These defects await
     full characterization. Insulin-sensitizing agents can reverse many of the
     effects of insulin resistance and may have a future place in the treatment
     of polycystic ovarian syndrome and other conditions associated with
     steroid-induced insulin resistance. Recognition and treatment of sex
     steroid-associated insulin resistance at an early stage in patients may
     reduce their risk of developing Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes
     mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidaemia, and so may improve fertility and
     reduce cardiovascular risk. Here we review the interplay between sex
     steroids and insulin resistance, and consider the implications this has
     for clinical conditions.

PG  - 83-93
AB  - IGF-I expression has been observed in human uterine leiomyomas. To examine
     whether autocrine IGF-I signaling plays a role in the growth of these
     tumors, we used an animal model of uterine leiomyoma (the Eker rat) to
     investigate regulation of IGF-I and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) expression
     in tumors and normal myometrium. During the normal estrous cycle,
     myometrial IGF-I expression peaked on the day of proestrus when the rate
     of proliferation in this tissue is greatest. In leiomyomas, the expression
     of IGF-I was increased 7.5-fold compared with the age-matched normal
     tissue. The level of IGF-IR mRNA in both tumor and non-tumor tissues was
     found to inversely correlate with that of IGF-I. Changes observed in IGF-I
     signaling components correlated with the activation state of the
     signal-transducing protein insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). During
     diestrus and proestrus when IGF-I levels were increasing, tyrosine
     phosphorylation of IRS-1 was increased up to 5.7-fold in the normal
     myometrium relative to estrus, when IGF-I levels were the lowest.
     Additionally, IRS-1 phosphorylation was 4-fold greater in leiomyomas
     relative to age-matched normal myometrium. Autocrine stimulation of the
     IGF-IR may, therefore, play a role in regulating the normal growth of the
     myometrium, and dysregulation of IGF-I signaling could contribute to the
     neoplastic growth of uterine leiomyomas.

TI  - Growth and characterization of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mammary
     tumors in intact and ovariectomized rats.
PG  - 2039-47
AB  - It is well established that 85-90% of chemically induced mammary tumors in
     rats will disappear or diminish significantly in size after the ovaries
     are removed from the animal. However, it is less well established whether
     a high percentage of these mammary tumors will grow back with prolonged
     time after ovariectomy. It is also not known what changes in gene
     expression take place in the tumors as they develop an independence from
     hormones for growth. This study was carried out to investigate this.
     Virgin, 50-day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with
     N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) at the dose of 50 mg MNU/kg body wt. When at
     least one mammary tumor had grown to 1.0-1.5 cm in one dimension, the
     animal was bilaterally ovariectomized and reduction and then re-growth of
     the tumors monitored. Control animals were treated identically except they
     were not ovariectomized when tumors appeared. Re-growths and new tumors
     and tumors that developed in the control rats were removed when they
     reached 1.0-1.5 cm in diameter and all animals were killed 25 weeks after
     the MNU injection. All the animals in the study (100%) developed mammary
     tumors after MNU injection with an average latency of 56.5 days. After
     ovariectomy, 93% of the tumors showed 50% or more reduction in size and
     76% of the tumors could not be detected by palpation. However, in 96% of
     the animals where tumor reduction or disappearance occurred, a re-growth
     or new mammary tumor development took place with an average latency period
     of 52.8 days from the day of ovariectomy. Of these post-ovariectomy
     tumors, 36% occurred at a location where tumors had developed prior to
     ovariectomy, but 64% appeared at new locations. The circulating levels of
     17beta-estradiol (E2) was undetectable in the ovariectomized (OVX) rats
     and significant reduction was seen in the serum concentrations of
     progesterone (P4), prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like
     growth factor-I (IGF-I). The tumors from the OVX rats showed indications
     of progression as evident from loss of differentiation and invasive
     characteristics. Comparison between tumors from OVX and intact rats
     revealed a significantly increased expression of P450 aromatase and
     elevated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2, but
     reduced levels of the progesterone receptor and cyclin D1 in OVX rats.
     However, the estrogen receptor (ER) content remained similar in tumors
     from both groups, at least at the protein level, and so did the expression
     of IGF-I, IGF-II, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), IRS-2 and epidermal
     growth factor receptor. IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and ErbB-2 were expressed,
     respectively, in 50 and 70% of the tumors from the OVX animals, whereas
     these genes were expressed in 100% of the tumors from the intact rats. It
     is concluded that chemically induced rat mammary tumors may still depend
     on the ER and local syntheses of E2 and growth factors for growth
     initially after ovariectomy. However, as these tumors progress, they
     develop a more aggressive phenotype and lose their dependency on the ER
     and possibly growth factors.

     neuroblastoma cell lines.
PG  - 161-70
AB  - The underlying neurochemical changes contributing to prion-induced
     neurodegeneration remain largely unknown. This study shows that scrapie
     infection induced a 2-fold increase of insulin receptor (IR) protein and
     aberrantly processed IR beta-chain in scrapie-infected N2a neuroblastoma
     cells (ScN2a) as measured by Western blot of immunoprecipitated IR, in the
     absence of increased IR mRNA. Elevated IR protein level was further
     confirmed in an independently scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cell line
     N1E-115 (ScN1E-115). Proliferation studies showed that the increased IR
     level in ScN2a did not result in an increased insulin-mediated cell growth
     compared to normal N2a cells. Binding studies indicated that this apparent
     paradox was due to a 65% decrease in specific [(125)I]insulin binding
     sites in ScN2a when compared to the amount of immunoreactive IR, although
     the IR binding affinity was unchanged. Analysis of insulin stimulated IR
     tyrosine phosphorylation showed a slight but not significant reduction in
     ScN2a, when related to the increased level of immunoreactive IR. However,
     comparing the IR tyrosine phosphorylation to the loss of binding sites in
     ScN2a, we demonstrated an increased IR tyrosine phosphorylation of the
     remaining functional IR. In addition to these differences in IR
     properties, the basal extracellular signal regulated kinase-2 (ERK2)
     phosphorylation detected by Western blot, was significantly elevated and
     the insulin stimulated ERK2 phosphorylation was subsequently decreased in
     ScN2a. Together, these data show that scrapie infection affects the level
     and processing of the IR and signal transduction mediated by the IR in
     neuroblastoma cells, as well as induces an elevated basal ERK2
     phosphorylation. Aberrant regulation of neuroprotective receptors may
     contribute to neurodegeneration in prion diseases.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor I stimulates motility in human neuroblastoma
     cells.
PG  - 7542-50
AB  - Motility is an important process that contributes to cancer cell spread.
     Growth factors are key regulators of motility in many cell types.
     Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) causes SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma
     cells to undergo dynamic morphological changes, leading to the extension
     of lamellipodia. IGF-I stimulated lamellipodia extension requires
     signaling through both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and MAP
     kinase pathways. IGF-I, over a period of hours, stimulates SH-SY5Y and
     SHEP neuroblastoma cells to become more motile. While SH-SY5Y and SHEP
     cells use different insulin receptor substrate (IRS) isoforms to transduce
     signals from the IGF-I receptor, IGF-I has the same relative effect on the
     motility of both cell lines. Blocking the PI3-K and MAP kinase pathways
     attenuates the ability of IGF-I to increase motility. Overexpression of
     PTEN also attenuates IGF-I mediated motility. These results delineate some
     of the proximal events in the signaling mechanism utilized by IGF-I to
     stimulate cell motility.

     hepatoma cells.
PG  - 5667-74
AB  - Ghrelin was identified in the stomach as an endogenous ligand specific for
     the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). GHS-R is found in
     various tissues, but its function is unknown. Here we show that GHS-R is
     found in hepatoma cells. Exposure of these cells to ghrelin caused
     up-regulation of several insulin-induced activities including tyrosine
     phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), association of
     the adapter molecule growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 with IRS-1,
     mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, and cell proliferation. Unlike
     insulin, ghrelin inhibited Akt kinase activity as well as up-regulated
     gluconeogenesis. These findings raise the possibility that ghrelin
     modulates insulin activities in humans.

TI  - Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase
     signaling pathways are required for the regulation of 5-aminolevulinate
     synthase gene expression by insulin.
PG  - 201-13
AB  - Insulin regulates the expression of several hepatic genes. Although the
     general definition of insulin signaling has progressed dramatically, the
     elucidation of the complete signaling pathway from insulin receptor to
     transcription factors involved in the regulation of a specific gene
     remains to be established. In fact, recent works suggest that multiple
     divergent insulin signaling pathways regulate the expression of distinct
     genes. 5-Aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme
     that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of heme biosynthesis. It
     has been reported that insulin caused the rapid inhibition of housekeeping
     ALAS transcription, but the mechanism involved in this repression has not
     been explored. The present study investigates the role of
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and mitogen-activated protein
     kinase pathways in insulin signaling relevant to ALAS inhibition. To
     explore this, we combined the transient overexpression of regulatory
     proteins involved in these pathways and the use of small cell permeant
     inhibitors in rat hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. Wortmannin and LY294002,
     PI3-kinase inhibitors, as well as lovastatin and PD152440, Ras
     farnesylation inhibitors, and MEK inhibitor PD98059 abolished the insulin
     repression of ALAS transcription. The inhibitor of mTOR/p70(S6K) rapamycin
     had no effect whatsoever upon hormone action. The overexpression of
     vectors encoding constitutively active Ras, MEK, or p90(RSK) mimicked the
     inhibitory action of insulin. Conversely, negative mutants of PKB, Ras, or
     MEK impaired insulin inhibition of ALAS promoter activity. Furthermore,
     inhibition of one of the pathways blocks the inhibitory effect produced by
     the activation of the other. Our findings suggest that factors involved in
     two signaling pathways that are often considered to be functionally
     separate during insulin action, the Ras/ERK/p90(RSK) pathway and the
     PI3K/PKB pathway, are jointly required for insulin-mediated inhibition of
     ALAS gene expression in rat hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells.

TI  - Regulation of breast cancer cell motility by insulin receptor substrate-2
     (IRS-2) in metastatic variants of human breast cancer cell lines.
PG  - 7318-25
AB  - Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) regulate breast cancer cell
     proliferation, protect cells from apoptosis, and enhance metastasis. In
     this study, we examined the IGF signaling pathway in two breast cancer
     cell lines selected for metastatic behavior. LCC6 was selected for growth
     as an ascites tumor in athymic mice from parental MDA-MB-435 cells (435P).
     The MDA-231BO cell line was derived from osseous metastases that formed
     after intracardiac injection of the MDA-MB-231 cell line in athymic mice.
     Compared to the parental cell lines, IGF-I treatment enhanced IRS-2
     phosphorylation over IRS-1 in the metastatic variants. IGF-I stimulated
     cell migration in the variant cells, but not in the parental cells. To
     determine the role for IRS-2 in IGF-mediated motility, we transfected
     MDA-231BO cells with an anti-sense IRS-2 construct. Transfected cells had
     decreased levels of IRS-2 with diminished IGF-mediated motility and
     anchorage independent growth when compared to control cells. However,
     adherence to fibronectin was enhanced in the transfected cells compared to
     MDA-231BO cells. Our data show that breast cancer cells selected for
     metastatic behavior in vivo have increased IRS-2 activation and signaling.
     In these cells, IGF-I enhances cell adhesion and motility suggesting that
     IRS-2 may mediate these aspects of the malignant phenotype.

TI  - Insulin inhibits leptin receptor signalling in HEK293 cells at the level
     of janus kinase-2: a potential mechanism for hyperinsulinaemia-associated
     leptin resistance.
PG  - 1125-32
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Leptin resistance in obese humans seems to be
     predominantly caused by signalling abnormalities at the post receptor
     level. Leptin resistance in obese individuals is frequently associated
     with insulin resistance and pronounced hyperinsulinaemia indicating a
     negative crosstalk of the insulin and leptin signalling chain. METHODS:
     This hypothesis was tested using a cell model of peripheral leptin
     signalling, i. e. insulin-secreting cell lines (RINr1046-38). Mechanisms
     for a crosstalk between the insulin and leptin signalling pathway were
     also studied in rat-1 and HEK293 cells overexpressing elements of the
     insulin and leptin signalling chain. RESULTS: The effects of leptin on
     insulin secretion are completely cancelled by a 4-h preincubation with 1
     nmol/l insulin, supporting the hypothesis of a negative crosstalk of
     insulin and leptin signalling. We investigated the potential molecular
     mechanisms in more detail in HEK293 cells and Rat-1 fibroblasts that
     overexpressed proteins of the insulin and leptin signalling chain. Leptin
     (60 ng/ml) stimulated autophosphorylation of JAK-2 in HEK 293 cells. This
     leptin effect could be inhibited by simultaneous treatment of cells with
     insulin. Furthermore, overexpression of the insulin receptor in HEK 293
     cells clearly reduced JAK-2 phosphorylation and led further downstream to
     a diminished phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. The inhibitory effect
     of the insulin signal could be partially prevented by transfection of the
     cells with an inactive mutant of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1.
     CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: In summary, our data suggest that the insulin
     receptor signalling pathway interferes with leptin signalling at the level
     of JAK-2. Inhibition of JAK-2 phosphorylation might occur through
     SHP-1-dependent pathways, indicating that hyperinsulinaemia contributes to
     the pathogenesis of leptin resistance.

TI  - Differential insulin-like growth factor I receptor signaling and function
     in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast
     cancer cells.
PG  - 6747-54
AB  - The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is a ubiquitous and
     multifunctional tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in breast cancer
     development. In estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors, the levels
     of the IGF-IR and its substrate, insulin-receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), are
     often elevated, and these characteristics have been linked with increased
     radioresistance and cancer recurrence. In vitro, activation of the
     IGF-IR/IRS-1 pathway in ER-positive cells improves growth and counteracts
     apoptosis induced by anticancer treatments. The function of the IGF-IR in
     hormone-independent breast cancer is not clear. ER-negative breast cancer
     cells often express low levels of the IGF-IR and fail to respond to IGF-I
     with mitogenesis. On the other hand, anti-IGF-IR strategies effectively
     reduced metastatic potential of different ER-negative cell lines,
     suggesting a role of this receptor in late stages of the disease. Here we
     examined IGF-IR signaling and function in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast
     cancer cells and their IGF-IR-overexpressing derivatives. We demonstrated
     that IGF-I acts as a chemoattractant for these cells. The extent of
     IGF-I-induced migration reflected IGF-IR levels and required the
     activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) and p38 kinases. The
     same pathways promoted IGF-I-dependent motility in ER-positive MCF-7
     cells. In contrast with the positive effects on cell migration, IGF-I was
     unable to stimulate growth or improve survival in MDA-MB-231 cells,
     whereas it induced mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects in MCF-7 cells.
     Moreover, IGF-I partially restored growth in ER-positive cells treated
     with PI-3K and ERK1/ERK2 inhibitors, whereas it had no protective effects
     in ER-negative cells. The impaired IGF-I growth response of ER-negative
     cells was not caused by a low IGF-IR expression, defective IGF-IR tyrosine
     phosphorylation, or improper tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Also, the
     acute (15-min) IGF-I activation of PI-3 and Akt kinases was similar in
     ER-negative and ER-positive cells. However, a chronic (2-day) IGF-I
     exposure induced the PI-3K/Akt pathway only in MCF-7 cells. The
     reactivation of this pathway in ER-negative cells by overexpression of
     constitutively active Akt mutants was not sufficient to significantly
     improve proliferation or survival (with or without IGF-I), which indicated
     that other pathways are also required to support these functions. Our
     results suggest that in breast cancer cells, IGF-IR can control
     nonmitogenic processes regardless of the ER status, whereas IGF-IR
     growth-related functions may depend on ER expression.

PG  - 40362-7
AB  - Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) regulate metabolism and
     body growth through homologous receptor tyrosine kinases that
     phosphorylate the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. IRS-2 is an
     important IRS protein, as it mediates peripheral insulin action and
     beta-cell survival. In this study, we show that insulin, IGF-1, or osmotic
     stress promoted ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-2 in
     3T3-L1 cells, Fao hepatoma, cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts; however,
     insulin/IGF-1 did not promote degradation of IRS-1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes
     or mouse embryo fibroblasts. MG132 or lactacystin, specific inhibitors of
     26S proteasome, blocked insulin/IGF-1-induced degradation of IRS-2 and
     enhanced the detection of ubiquitinated IRS-2. Insulin/IGF1-induced
     ubiquitination and degradation of IRS-2 was blocked by inhibitors of
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin or LY294002) or mTOR
     (rapamycin). Chronic insulin or IGF-1 treatment of IRS-1-deficient mouse
     embryo fibroblasts inhibited IRS-2-mediated activation of Akt and ERK1/2,
     which was reversed by lactacystin pretreatment. By contrast, IRS-1
     activation of Akt and ERK1/2 was not inhibited by chronic insulin/IGF-1
     stimulation in IRS-2-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts. Thus, we
     identified a novel negative feedback mechanism by which the
     ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-2 limits the magnitude
     and duration of the response to insulin or IGF-1.

PG  - 1011-26
AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor plays crucial roles throughout the
     development of multicellular organisms, and inappropriate activation of
     the receptor is associated with neoplastic transformation of many cell
     types. The receptor is thought to be activated by ligand-induced
     homodimerisation. Here, however, we show by chemical cross-linking and
     sucrose density-gradient centrifugation that in the absence of bound
     ligand the receptor has an ability to form a dimer and exists as a
     preformed dimer on the cell surface. We also analysed the receptor
     dimerisation by inserting cysteine residues at strategic positions about
     the putative alpha-helix axis of the extracellular juxtamembrane region.
     The mutant receptors spontaneously formed disulphide bridges and
     transformed NIH3T3 cells in the absence of ligand, depending upon the
     positions of the cysteine residue inserted. Kinetic analyses of the
     disulphide bonding indicate that EGF binding induces flexible rotation or
     twist of the juxtamembrane region of the receptor in the plane parallel
     with the lipid bilayer. The binding of an ATP competitor to the
     intracellular domain also induced similar flexible rotation of the
     juxtamembrane region. All the disulphide-bonded dimers had flexible
     ligand-binding domains with the same biphasic affinities for EGF as the
     wild-type. These results demonstrate that ligand binding to the flexible
     extracellular domains of the receptor dimer induce rotation or twist of
     the juxtamembrane regions, hence the transmembrane domains, and dissociate
     the dimeric, inactive form of the intracellular domains. The flexible
     rotation of the intracellular domains may be necessary for the intrinsic
     catalytic kinase to become accessible to the multiple tyrosine residues
     present in the regulatory domain and various substrates, and may be a
     common property of many cell-surface receptors, such as the insulin
     receptor.

     mitogenic functions mainly through the IGF-I receptor. Recently, we
     identified the insulin receptor isoform A (IR(A)) as an additional high
     affinity receptor for IGF-II in both fetal and cancer cells. Here we
     investigated the mitogenic signaling of IGF-II via the Akt/Glycogen
     synthase kinase 3 (Gsk3) axis employing R-IR(A) cells that are IGF-I
     receptor null mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing the human IR(A).
     IGF-II induced activation of the proto-oncogenic serine kinase Akt,
     reaching maximal at 5-10 min. IGF-II also caused the rapid and sustained
     deactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (Gsk3beta), reaching
     maximal at 1-3 min, shortly preceding, therefore, maximal activation of
     Akt. Under our conditions, IGF-II and insulin induced 70-80% inhibition of
     Gsk3betaactivity. In these cells IGF-II also deactivated Gsk3alpha
     although less effectively than Gsk3beta. In parallel experiments, we found
     that IGF-II induced transient activation of extracellular-signal-regulated
     kinases (Erk) reaching maximal at 5-10 min and decreasing thereafter. Time
     courses and potencies of regulation of both mitogenic pathways
     (Akt/Gsk3beta and Erk) by IGF-II via IR(A) were similar to those of
     insulin. Furthermore, IGF-II like insulin effectively stimulated cell
     cycle progression from the G0/G1 to the S and G2/M phases. Interestingly,
     AP-1-mediated gene expression, that was reported to be negatively
     regulated by Gsk3beta was only weakly increased after IGF-II stimulation.
     Our present data suggest that the coordinated activation or deactivation
     of Akt, Gsk3beta, and Erk may account for IGF-II mitogenic effects and
     support an active role for IR(A) in IGF-II action.

TI  - Re-expression of estrogen receptor alpha in estrogen receptor
     alpha-negative MCF-7 cells restores both estrogen and insulin-like growth
     factor-mediated signaling and growth.
PG  - 5771-7
AB  - Estrogen can increase insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and
     insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) expression, two key components of
     IGF-I-mediated signaling. The result is sensitization of breast cancer
     cells to IGF-I and synergistic growth in the presence of estrogen and
     IGF-I. We hypothesized that loss of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)
     would result in reduced IGF-mediated signaling and growth. To test this
     hypothesis, we examined IGF-I effects in MCF-7 breast cancer cell sublines
     that have been selected for loss of ERalpha (C4 and C4-12 cells are
     ERalpha-negative) by long-term estrogen withdrawal. C4 and C4-12 cells had
     reduced IGF-IR and IRS-1 mRNA and protein expression (compared with MCF-7
     cells) that was not inducible by estrogen. Furthermore, C4 and C4-12 cells
     showed reduced IGF-I signaling and failed to show any growth response to
     either estrogen or IGF-I. To prove that loss of IGF and estrogen-mediated
     signaling and growth was a consequence of loss of ERalpha, we re-expressed
     ERalpha in C4-12 cells by stable transfection with HA-tagged ERalpha.
     Three independent C4-12 ERalpha-HA clones expressed a functional ERalpha
     that (a) was down-regulated by estrogen, (b) conferred estrogen-induction
     of cyclin D1 expression, and (c) caused estrogen-mediated increase in the
     number of cells in S phase. All of the effects were completely blocked by
     antiestrogens. Interestingly, ERalpha-HA expression in C4-12 cells did not
     restore estrogen induction of progesterone receptor expression. However,
     ERalpha-positive C4-12 cells now exhibited estrogen-induction of IGF-IR
     and IRS-1 levels and responded mitogenically to both estrogen and IGF-I.
     These data show that ERalpha is a critical requirement for IGF signaling,
     and to our knowledge this is the first report of functional ERalpha
     expression that confers estrogen-mediated growth of an ER-negative breast
     cancer cell line.

     insulin receptor-deficient hepatocytes.
PG  - 3354-60
AB  - We have previously shown that hepatocytes lacking insulin receptors
     (Ir-/-) fail to mediate metabolic responses, such as stimulation of
     glycogen synthesis, while retaining the ability to proliferate in response
     to IGFs. In this study we have asked whether overexpression of type I IGF
     receptors would rescue the metabolic response of Ir-/- hepatocytes. After
     IGF-I stimulation, insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 phosphorylation and
     PI3K activity were restored to levels similar to or greater than those
     seen in wild-type cells. Rates of cell proliferation in response to IGF-I
     increased approximately 2-fold, whereas glycogen synthesis was restored to
     wild-type levels, but was comparatively smaller than that elicited by
     overexpression of insulin receptors. In summary, overexpression of IGF-I
     receptors in Ir-/- hepatocytes normalized insulin receptor substrate-2
     phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis to wild-type levels, whereas it
     increased cell proliferation above wild-type levels. Moreover, stimulation
     of glycogen synthesis was submaximal compared with the effect of insulin
     receptor overexpression. We conclude that IGF-I receptors are more
     efficiently coupled to cell proliferation than insulin receptors, but are
     less potent than insulin receptors in stimulating glycogen synthesis. The
     data are consistent with the possibility that there exist intrinsic
     signaling differences between insulin and IGF-I receptors.

     transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on growth and apoptosis of
     human osteosarcoma Saos-2/B-10 cells: lack of IGF-independent IGFBP-3
     effects.
PG  - 213-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) inhibits
     cell growth. Previous reports have suggested the existence of plasma
     membrane IGFBP-3 receptors that could mediate direct, IGF-independent
     effects. Thus far, however, the only well-defined putative IGFBP-3
     receptor is the type V transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)
     receptor, a membrane glycoprotein that mediates TGF-beta-induced growth
     inhibition in selected cells. The aim of the study was to test whether
     IGFBP-3 and TGF-beta exert short-term effects in an osteosarcoma cell line
     that produces no IGF but contains type 1 IGF receptors. DESIGN: DNA
     synthesis and apoptosis in Saos-2/B-10 cells were measured in response to
     IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-3 and TGF-beta2, and to type 1 IGF receptor ligands
     with poor affinity for IGFBP-3 ([QAYL]-IGF-I and insulin). RESULTS: IGF-I
     and IGF-II stimulated thymidine incorporation into DNA and suppressed
     apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner with maximal effects at 1 and 3 nM
     respectively. TGF-beta2 slightly increased thymidine incorporation into
     DNA but had no effect on apoptosis. IGFBP-3 had no effect by itself.
     Whereas it blocked the above effects of 1 nmol/l IGF-I, it did not block
     those of 1 nmol/l [QAYL]-IGF-I or 100 nmol/l insulin. CONCLUSIONS: IGFBP-3
     does not affect DNA synthesis or apoptosis in an IGF-independent manner in
     IGF-responsive osteosarcoma cells. It therefore appears to act essentially
     by sequestration of IGF.

TI  - A PDZ domain protein interacts with the C-terminal tail of the
     insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor but not with the insulin receptor.
PG  - 33419-27
AB  - In this study, we report on the isolation of a PDZ domain protein, here
     designated as IIP-1, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)
     receptor-interacting protein-1, which binds to the IGF-1 receptor, but not
     to the related insulin receptor, and which is involved in the regulation
     of cell motility. The interaction between the IGF-1 receptor and IIP-1 as
     well as a splice variant IIP-1/p26 was demonstrated in the yeast
     two-hybrid system. Using co-precipitation experiments, we confirmed the
     interaction in transfected cells as well as in vitro. Analysis of deletion
     mutants indicates that the PDZ domain of IIP-1 mediates interaction with
     the C-terminal tail of the IGF-1 receptor (serine-threonine-cysteine).
     This finding demonstrates that the C terminus of the IGF-1 receptor acts
     as novel PDZ domain binding site. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed an
     overlapping localization of IIP-1 and the IGF-1 receptor in the breast
     cancer cell line MCF-7. A functional connection between IIP-1 and the
     IGF-1 receptor is further supported by the finding that the level of
     expression of IIP-1 and the IGF-1 receptor strongly correlates in
     different normal and cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of IIP-1
     resulted in an attenuation of migration of MCF-7 cells, which is one of
     the biological activities mediated by the IGF-1 signaling system.

TI  - Phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase-independent insulin action pathway(s) in
     the human ovary.
PG  - 3115-9
AB  - Hyperandrogenism observed in women with a variety of insulin-resistant
     states is thought to be due to a stimulatory effect of insulin on ovarian
     steroid hormone production. However, it is not known what mechanisms could
     allow the ovary to remain sensitive to insulin while classical target
     organs for insulin action (liver, fat, and muscle) exhibit insulin
     resistance. One hypothesis proposed to explain this paradox suggests that
     a postbinding divergence of insulin receptor signaling occurs in the ovary
     and that signaling pathways for steroid hormone synthesis and other
     ovarian effects of insulin may be distinct from classical glucose
     signaling pathways. We now report that activation of
     phosphatidyl-inositol-3 (PI-3) kinase, which is crucial for glucose
     transport, is not necessary for the insulin-induced stimulation of
     progesterone production or for the insulin-induced inhibition of
     insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) production in
     cultured human ovarian cells. Human granulosa cells obtained during in
     vitro fertilization procedures were cultured with 10, 10(2), 10(3), or
     10(4) ng/mL insulin with or without preincubation with 100 nM wortmannin,
     a specific irreversible inhibitor of PI-3 kinase. IGFBP-1 concentration in
     the conditioned medium was measured using immunoradiometric assay or by
     Western blot analysis. Progesterone concentration was measured using RIA.
     Additional studies were carried out in cultures of human ovarian cells
     prepared from homogenized whole ovarian tissue of a woman with a family
     history of breast cancer and a mutation of BRCA-1 gene who underwent
     bilateral oophorectomy. These cells were cultured with 10(3) ng/mL insulin
     with or without preincubation with 100 nM wortmannin. Two-way ANOVA was
     used to compare mean values of IGFBP-1 and progesterone according to
     insulin dose and the use of wortmannin. In cultured granulosa cell medium,
     progesterone production was stimulated by insulin in a dose-related manner
     up to 175% of control (P < 0.0001). In tissue culture medium from ovarian
     cells obtained from a patient with BRCA-gene mutation, concentration of
     progesterone in the tissue culture medium increased from 2.5 +/- 0.2 ng/mL
     for control to 5.4 +/- 0.3 ng/mL for cells incubated with insulin (P <
     0.001). IGFBP-1 production in tissue culture medium from human granulosa
     cells was inhibited by insulin to the nadir of 45% of control (P <
     0.0001). Preincubation with wortmannin, despite complete inhibition of
     PI-3 kinase in both cell systems confirmed by Western blot analysis,
     failed to significantly alter these results. We conclude that inhibition
     of PI-3 kinase by wortmannin fails to abolish stimulatory effect of
     insulin on progesterone production or inhibitory effect of insulin on
     IGFBP-1 production in cultured human ovarian cells. These findings suggest
     that activation of PI-3 kinase, an enzyme crucial for insulin-stimulated
     glucose transport, is not necessary for the above effects of insulin in
     the ovary. These data provide evidence for the presence of PI-3
     kinase-independent insulin signaling pathway(s) in human ovarian cells.

AB  - Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are insulin resistant
     secondary to a postbinding defect in insulin signaling. Sequential
     euglycemic glucose clamp studies at 40 and 400 mU. m(-2). min(-1) insulin
     doses with serial skeletal muscle biopsies were performed in PCOS and
     age-, weight-, and ethnicity-matched control women. Steady-state insulin
     levels did not differ, but insulin-mediated glucose disposal was
     significantly decreased in PCOS women (P < 0.05). Insulin receptor
     substrate (IRS)-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3K)
     activity was significantly decreased in PCOS (n = 12) compared with
     control skeletal muscle (n = 8; P < 0.05). There was no significant
     difference in the abundance of IR, IRS-1, or the p85 regulatory subunit of
     PI 3K in PCOS (n = 14) compared with control (n = 12) muscle. The
     abundance of IRS-2 was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in PCOS skeletal
     muscle, suggesting a compensatory change. We conclude that there is a
     physiologically relevant defect in insulin receptor signaling in PCOS that
     is independent of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Identification of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 as
     signaling intermediates in the alpha6beta4 integrin-dependent activation
     of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase and promotion of invasion.
PG  - 5082-93
AB  - Expression of the alpha6beta4 integrin increases the invasive potential of
     carcinoma cells by a mechanism that involves activation of
     phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K). In the present study, we investigated
     the signaling pathway by which the alpha6beta4 integrin activates PI3K.
     Neither the alpha6 nor the beta4 cytoplasmic domain contains the consensus
     binding motif for PI3K, pYMXM, indicating that additional proteins are
     likely to be involved in the activation of this lipid kinase by the
     alpha6beta4 integrin. We identified insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)
     and IRS-2 as signaling intermediates in the activation of PI3K by the
     alpha6beta4 integrin. IRS-1 and IRS-2 are cytoplasmic adapter proteins
     that do not contain intrinsic kinase activity but rather function by
     recruiting proteins to surface receptors, where they organize signaling
     complexes. Ligation of the alpha6beta4 receptor promotes tyrosine
     phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and increases their association with
     PI3K, as determined by coimmunoprecipitation. Moreover, we identified a
     tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of the beta4 subunit, Y1494,
     that is required for alpha6beta4-dependent phosphorylation of IRS-2 and
     activation of PI3K in response to receptor ligation. Most importantly,
     Y1494 is essential for the ability of the alpha6beta4 integrin to promote
     carcinoma invasion. Taken together, these results imply a key role for the
     IRS proteins in the alpha6beta4-dependent promotion of carcinoma invasion.

     by insulin: insights into the signaling pathway.
PG  - 1522-30
AB  - Impairment of the fibrinolytic system, caused primarily by increases in
     the plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) type 1, are
     frequently found in diabetes and the insulin-resistance syndrome. Among
     the factors responsible for the increases of PAI-1, insulin has recently
     attracted attention. In this study, we analyzed the effects of insulin on
     PAI-1 biosynthesis in HepG2 cells, paying particular attention to the
     signaling network evoked by this hormone. Experiments performed in CHO
     cells overexpressing the insulin receptor indicate that insulin increases
     PAI-1 gene transcription through interaction with its receptor. By using
     inhibitors of the different signaling pathways evoked by insulin-receptor
     binding, it has been shown that the biosynthesis of PAI-1 is due to
     phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activation, followed by protein kinase
     C and ultimately by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and
     extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 phosphorylation. We also showed
     that this pathway is Ras-independent. Transfection of HepG2 cells with
     several truncations of the PAI-1 promoter coupled to a CAT gene allowed us
     to recognize two major response elements located in the regions between
     -804 and -708 and between -211 and -54. Electrophoretic mobility shift
     assay identified three binding sites for insulin-induced factors, all
     colocalized with putative Sp1 binding sites. Using supershifting
     antibodies, the binding of Sp1 could only be confirmed at the binding site
     located just upstream from the transcription start site of the PAI-1
     promoter. A construct comprising four tandem repeat copies of the -93/-62
     region of the PAI-1 promoter linked to CAT was transcriptionally activated
     in HepG2 cells by insulin. These results outline the central role of MAP
     kinase activation in the regulation of PAI-1 induced by insulin.

AB  - A property of signal transduction pathways that might explain their
     efficiency and specificity is the formation of signaling complexes. The
     recent demonstration that adaptor proteins can interact with many
     components of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) signaling
     cascade leads us to investigate whether such complexes may include the
     transmembrane receptor. The present work shows that in human hepatoma
     Hep3B cells, insulin receptor (IR) can be coimmunoprecipitated with other
     components of the ERKs cascade: insulin receptor substrate (IRS), Raf-1,
     and ERKs. Furthermore, these complexes formed near the cytoplasmic
     membrane even prior to insulin stimulation.

AB  - Exogenous administration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves insulin
     sensitivity, but its precise mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that
     EPA stimulates the intracellular insulin signaling pathway in hepatoma
     cells. Exposure of these cells to EPA caused up-regulation of several
     insulin-induced activities including tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin
     receptor substrate-1, insulin receptor substrate-1-associated
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and its downstream target Akt kinase
     activity as well as down-regulation of gluconeogenesis. In contrast, EPA
     decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and inhibited cell
     proliferation. These findings raise the possibility that EPA up-regulates
     metabolic action of insulin and inhibits cell growth in humans.

TI  - Multiple signal transduction pathways mediate interleukin-4-induced
     3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta5-Delta4 isomerase in normal and
     tumoral target tissues.
PG  - 213-25
AB  - The 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta5-Delta4 isomerase (3beta-HSD)
     isoenzymes catalyze an essential step in the formation of all classes of
     active steroid hormones. We have recently shown that 3beta-HSD type 1 gene
     expression is specifically induced by interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 in
     several human cancer cell lines and in normal human mammary and prostatic
     epithelial cells in primary culture. There is evidence that IL-4
     stimulates bifurcating signaling pathways in which the Stat6-signal
     pathway is involved in differentiation and gene regulation, whereas
     insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins mediate the mitogenic action of
     IL-4. As a matter of fact, we have shown that IL-4-activated Stat6 in all
     cell lines studied, where IL-4 induced 3beta-HSD type 1 expression but not
     in those cell lines that failed to respond to IL-4. The mechanism of the
     induction of 3beta-HSD type 1 gene expression was further characterized in
     ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells. We have also found that IL-4 rapidly
     induced IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation in these cell lines. Moreover,
     insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and insulin, which are well known to
     cause IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation, increased the stimulatory effect of
     IL-4 on 3beta-HSD activity. IRS-1 and IRS-2 are adapter molecules that
     provide docking sites for different SH2 domain-containing proteins,
     leading to the activation of multiple pathways, such as the
     phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
     pathways. The inhibition of IL-4-induced 3beta-HSD expression by PI
     3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) as well as an inhibitor of
     MAP kinase activation (PD98059), indicates the involvement of those
     pathways in this response to IL-4. Wortmannin also blocked MAP kinase
     activation by IL-4, insulin and IGF-1 suggesting that the MAP kinase
     cascade acts as a downstream effector of PI 3-kinases. Furthermore, we
     showed that the PKC activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) also
     potentiated the IL-4-induced 3beta-HSD activity, thus suggesting that one
     signaling molecule that is involved in the signal transduction of the IL-4
     action on 3beta-HSD type 1 expression is also a substrate for PKC. Taken
     together, these findings suggest the existence of a novel mechanism of
     gene regulation by IL-4. This mechanism would involve in the
     phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, which transduce the IL-4 signal
     through a PI 3-kinase- and MAP kinase-dependent signaling pathway.
     However, the inability of IGF-1, insulin and PMA to stimulate 3beta-HSD
     type 1 expression by themselves in the absence of IL-4 indicates that the
     multiple pathways downstream of IRS-1 and IRS-2 must act in cooperation
     with an IL-4-specific signaling molecule, such as the transcription factor
     Stat6. It is also of interest to note that there also appear to be
     differences between the regulation of the 3beta-HSD type 1 and type 2
     promoters.

     MCF-7 breast cancer cells: new insights into their synergistic effects.
PG  - 149-54
AB  - In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor
     (IGF-1R) and the oestrogen receptor (ER) are coexpressed and the two
     signalling systems are engaged in a crosstalk that results in synergistic
     growth. However, coupling between the signalling cascades is poorly
     understood. Oestradiol enhances IGF-1R signalling by inducing the
     expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), a substrate of the
     IGF-1R. Oestradiol induced expression of IRS-1 results in enhanced
     tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 after IGF-1 stimulation, followed by
     enhanced mitogen activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3' kinase, and
     Akt activation. Oestradiol can also potentiate the effect of IGF-1 on the
     expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E, and on the phosphorylation of the
     retinoblastoma protein (RB). These effects are greatly diminished in SX13
     cells, which exhibit a 50% reduction in IGF-1R expression but few
     functional IGF-1Rs at the surface. Oestradiol and IGF-1 regulate the
     expression of two cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27,
     differently. Whereas IGF-1 increases p21 expression and reduces p27
     expression, oestradiol has no effect on p21. In summary, in MCF-7 cells,
     oestrogen potentiates the effect of IGF-1 on IGF-1R signalling and its
     effects on certain cell cycle components.

     the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Characteristic

     Alterations of IGFBP production and the proteolytic degradation of IGFBPs
     resulting in an excess of bioactive IGFs, as well as the defective
     function of the IGF degrading IGF-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor

     high, the signal is mitogenic, anti-apoptotic, and can even cause

     sends a differentiation signal, which leads to granulocytic
     differentiation in haemopoietic cells. The mitogenic signal of the

     activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K).

TI  - The IGF system in thyroid cancer: new concepts.
PG  - 121-4
AB  - In recent years, the activation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)
     system in cancer has emerged as a key factor for tumour progression and
     resistance to apoptosis. Therefore, a variety of strategies have been
     developed to block the type I IGF receptor (IGF-I-R), which is thought to
     mediate the biological effects of both IGF-I and IGF-II. However, recent
     data suggest that the IGF signalling system is complex and that other
     receptors are involved. To unravel the complexity of the IGF system in
     thyroid cancer, IGF-I and IGF-II production, and the expression and
     function of their cognate receptors were studied. Both IGFs were found to
     be locally produced in thyroid cancer: IGF-I by stromal cells and IGF-II
     by malignant thyrocytes. Values were significantly higher in malignant
     tissue than in normal tissue. IGF-I-Rs were overexpressed in
     differentiated papillary carcinomas but not in poorly differentiated or
     undifferentiated tumours, whereas insulin receptors (IRs) were greatly
     overexpressed in all tumour hystotypes, with a trend for higher values in
     dedifferentiated tumours. As a consequence of IR overexpression, high
     amounts of IR/IGF-I-R hybrids (which bind IGF-I with high affinity) were
     present in all thyroid cancer histotypes. Because of recent evidence that
     isoform A of IR (IR-A) is a physiological receptor for IGF-II in fetal
     life, the relative abundance of IR-A in thyroid cancer was measured.
     Preliminary data indicate that overexpressed IRs mainly occur as IR-A in
     thyroid cancer. These data indicate that both IR/IGF-I-R hybrids and IR-A
     play an important role in the overactivation of the IGF system in thyroid
     cancer and in IGF-I mitogenic signalling in these tumours. J Clin PATHOL:

     containing 1 (SORBS1) gene: a protein associated with c-Abl during insulin
     signaling in the hepatoma cell line Hep3B.
PG  - 12-20
AB  - SH3P12/CAP/ponsin, a gene product with a sorbin homology domain and three
     consecutive SH3 domains in the carboxy-terminus, has been isolated from
     murine adipocytes and identified as an important adaptor during insulin
     signaling. Here we describe the cloning, mapping, and expression of the
     human homologue, termed SORBS1 (sorbin and SH3 domain containing 1).
     Multiple transcripts of this gene with different mRNA isoforms were
     observed among different tissues. Here we report 13 alternatively spliced
     exons, which were ascertained from the full-length cDNA cloned in adipose,
     liver, and skeletal muscle tissues. Among the major isoforms, the
     shortest, 2223-bp, open reading frame (ORF) encodes a protein with a
     predicted molecular weight of 81.5 kDa, while the longest, 3879-bp, ORF
     encodes a protein of about 142.2 kDa. This gene was mapped to human
     chromosome 10q23.3-q24.1, which is a candidate region for insulin
     resistance found in Pima Indians. In human hepatoma Hep3B cells, SORBS1
     was partly dissociated from the insulin receptor complex and bound to
     c-Abl protein upon insulin stimulation. This interaction with c-Abl was
     through the third SH3 domain and a possible conformational change of
     SORBS1 induced by insulin. Our data suggest that c-Abl oncoprotein via
     SORBS1 might play a role in the insulin signaling pathway.

TI  - PTEN expression causes feedback upregulation of insulin receptor substrate
     2.
PG  - 3947-58
AB  - PTEN is a tumor suppressor that antagonizes phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase
     (PI3K) by dephosphorylating the D3 position of phosphatidylinositol
     (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3). Given the importance of PTEN in
     regulating PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 levels, we used Affymetrix GeneChip arrays to
     identify genes regulated by PTEN. PTEN expression rapidly reduced the
     activity of Akt, which was followed by a G(1) arrest and eventually
     apoptosis. The gene encoding insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2), a
     mediator of insulin signaling, was found to be the most induced gene at
     all time points. A PI3K-specific inhibitor, LY294002, also upregulated
     IRS-2, providing evidence that it was the suppression of the PI3K pathway
     that was responsible for the message upregulation. In addition, PTEN,
     LY294002, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin,
     caused a reduction in the molecular weight of IRS-2 and an increase in the
     association of IRS-2 with PI3K. Apparently, PTEN inhibits a negative
     regulator of IRS-2 to upregulate the IRS-2-PI3K interaction. These studies
     suggest that PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 levels regulate the specific activity and
     amount of IRS-2 available for insulin signaling.

TI  - Insulin-stimulated hydrogen peroxide reversibly inhibits protein-tyrosine
     phosphatase 1b in vivo and enhances the early insulin action cascade.
PG  - 21938-42
AB  - The insulin signaling pathway is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation of
     the insulin receptor and key post-receptor substrate proteins and balanced
     by the action of specific protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). PTPase
     activity, in turn, is highly regulated in vivo by oxidation/reduction
     reactions involving the cysteine thiol moiety required for catalysis. Here
     we show that insulin stimulation generates a burst of intracellular
     H(2)O(2) in insulin-sensitive hepatoma and adipose cells that is
     associated with reversible oxidative inhibition of up to 62% of overall
     cellular PTPase activity, as measured by a novel method using strictly
     anaerobic conditions. The specific activity of immunoprecipitated PTP1B, a
     PTPase homolog implicated in the regulation of insulin signaling, was also
     strongly inhibited by up to 88% following insulin stimulation. Catalase
     pretreatment abolished the insulin-stimulated production of H(2)O(2) as
     well as the inhibition of cellular PTPases, including PTP1B, and was
     associated with reduced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of its
     receptor and high M(r) insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. These
     data provide compelling new evidence for a redox signal that enhances the
     early insulin-stimulated cascade of tyrosine phosphorylation by oxidative
     inactivation of PTP1B and possibly other tyrosine phosphatases.

PG  - 13644-9
AB  - The receptor for the type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) has been
     implicated in cellular transformation and the acquisition of an
     invasive/metastatic phenotype in various tumors. Following ligand binding,
     the IGF-I receptor is internalized, and the receptor.ligand complex
     dissociates as the ligand is degraded by endosomal proteinases. In the
     present study we show that the inhibition of endosomal IGF-I-degrading
     enzymes in human breast and murine lung carcinoma cells by the cysteine
     proteinase inhibitors, E-64 and CA074-methyl ester, profoundly altered
     receptor trafficking and signaling. In treated cells, intracellular ligand
     degradation was blocked, and although the receptor and two substrates, Shc
     and Insulin receptor substrate, were hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine,
     IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis, anchorage-independent growth, and matrix
     metalloproteinase synthesis were inhibited. The results suggest that
     ligand processing by endosomal proteinases is a key step in receptor
     signaling and function and a potential target for therapy.

     substrate-1 (IRS-1). A self-attenuated mechanism to negatively regulate
     the function of IRS proteins.
PG  - 14459-65
AB  - Incubation of rat hepatoma Fao cells with insulin leads to a transient
     rise in Tyr phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins.
     This is followed by elevation in their P-Ser/Thr content, and their
     dissociation from the insulin receptor (IR). Wortmannin, a
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, abolished the increase in
     the P-Ser/Thr content of IRS-1, its dissociation from the IR, and the
     decrease in its P-Tyr content following 60 min of insulin treatment,
     indicating that the Ser kinases that negatively regulate IRS-1 function
     are downstream effectors of PI3K. PKCzeta fulfills this criterion, being
     an insulin-activated downstream effector of PI3K. Overexpression of
     PKCzeta in Fao cells, by infection of the cells with adenovirus-based
     PKCzeta construct, had no effect on its own, but it accelerated the rate
     of insulin-stimulated dissociation of IR.IRS-1 complexes and the rate of
     Tyr dephosphorylation of IRS-1. The insulin-stimulated negative regulatory
     role of PKCzeta was specific and could not be mimic by infecting Fao cells
     with adenoviral constructs encoding for PKC alpha, delta, or eta. Because
     the reduction in P-Tyr content of IRS-1 was accompanied by a reduced
     association of IRS-1 with p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, it suggests
     that this negative regulatory process induced by PKCzeta, has a built-in
     attenuation signal. Hence, insulin triggers a sequential cascade in which
     PI3K-mediated activation of PKCzeta inhibits IRS-1 functions, reduces
     complex formation between IRS-1 and PI3K, and inhibits further activation
     of PKCzeta itself. These findings implicate PKCzeta as a key element in a
     multistep negative feedback control mechanism of IRS-1 functions.

TI  - Loss of insulin-like growth factor II receptor expression promotes growth
     in cancer by increasing intracellular signaling from both IGF-I and
     insulin receptors.
PG  - 388-96
AB  - The insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (IGF-IIR) is frequently mutated
     or deleted in some malignant human tumors, suggesting that the IGF-IIR is
     a tumor suppressor. However, the exact mechanism by which IGF-IIR
     suppresses growth in tumors has not been definitively established. We
     demonstrate that IGF-IIR-deficient murine L cells (D9) have higher growth
     rates than IGF-IIR-positive L cells (Cc2) in response to IGF-II. IGF-II
     levels are higher in growth-conditioned medium from D9 versus Cc2 cells.
     Receptor neutralization studies and measurements of insulin receptor
     substrate 1 phosphorylation confirm that the enhanced growth of D9 cells
     is due to increased stimulation of the IGF-I and insulin receptors by
     IGF-II. In contrast, the levels of secreted latent and active transforming
     growth factor beta (TGF-beta) are similar for both D9 and Cc2 cells,
     indicating that the slower growth of Cc2 cells is not due to activation of
     latent TGF-beta by IGF-IIR and growth inhibition. The results directly
     demonstrate that down regulation of the IGF-IIR promotes the growth of
     transformed D9 cells by sustaining IGF-II, which binds to and activates
     IGF-IR and insulin receptor to increase intracellular growth signals.

PG  - 295-308
AB  - Over the past 20 years, it has been clearly documented that 1) polycystic
     ovary syndrome (PCOS) has major metabolic sequelae related to insulin
     resistance and 2) insulin resistance plays an important role in the
     pathogenesis of the reproductive abnormalities of the disorder. Women with
     PCOS are at significantly increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes
     mellitus (DM). Studies in isolated adipocytes and in cultured skin
     fibroblasts from PCOS women have demonstrated intrinsic postbinding
     defects in insulin-mediated glucose metabolism. In fibroblasts, the
     mitogenic pathway of insulin action is intact, consistent with a selective
     defect in insulin signaling. While PCOS skeletal muscle is resistant to
     insulin in vivo, cultured muscle cells have normal insulin sensitivity,
     consistent with a major role of extrinsic factors in producing insulin
     resistance in this tissue. Excessive serine phosphorylation of the insulin
     receptor or downstream signaling proteins may be involved in the
     pathogenesis of insulin resistance in PCOS. The putative serine kinase is
     extrinsic to the insulin receptor but its identity is unknown. The
     explanations for tissue-specific and signaling pathway-specific
     differences in insulin action in PCOS are unknown but may involve
     differential roles of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 in
     insulin signal transduction.

TI  - PTEN inhibits insulin-stimulated MEK/MAPK activation and cell growth by
     blocking IRS-1 phosphorylation and IRS-1/Grb-2/Sos complex formation in a
     breast cancer model.
PG  - 605-16
AB  - The tumour suppressor gene PTEN encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase
     that recognizes protein substrates and
     phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate. PTEN seems to play multiple roles
     in tumour suppression and the blockade of phosphoinositide-3-kinase
     signalling is important for its growth suppressive effects, although
     precise mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we show that
     PTEN plays a unique role in the insulin-signalling pathway in a breast
     cancer model. Ectopic expression of wild-type PTEN in MCF-7 epithelial
     breast cancer cells resulted in universal inhibition of Akt
     phosphorylation in response to stimulation by diverse growth factors and
     selective inhibition of MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
     phosphorylation stimulated by insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1
     (IGF-1). The latter was accompanied by a decrease in the phosphorylation
     of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and the association of IRS-1 with
     Grb2/Sos, without affecting the phosphorylation status of the insulin
     receptor and Shc, nor Shc/Grb2 complex formation. The MEK inhibitor,
     PD980059, but not the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolished the effect of
     PTEN on insulin-stimulated cell growth. Without addition of insulin,
     wortmannin reduced PTEN-mediated growth suppression, whereas PD980059 had
     little effect, suggesting that PTEN suppresses insulin-stimulated cell
     growth by blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
     Furthermore, PD980059 treatment led to the downregulation of cyclin D1 and
     the suppression of cell cycle progression. Our data suggest that PTEN
     blocks MAPK phosphorylation in response to insulin stimulation by
     inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-1/Grb2/Sos complex
     formation, which leads to downregulation of cyclin D1, inhibition of cell
     cycle progression and suppression of cell growth.

TI  - PS6K amplification characterizes a small subset of anaplastic meningiomas.
PG  - 213-8
AB  - PS6K, a putative oncogene mapped to chromosome 17q23, encodes a
     serine/threonine kinase, which phosphorylates ribosomal subunit 6 and is
     part of the insulin receptor signal transduction pathway involved in the
     regulation of messenger RNA translation, protein synthesis, cell cycle
     progression, and cell size. Comparative genomic hybridization studies have
     detected 17q23 amplifications in a subset of meningiomas, particularly
     those with aggressive histologic features. PS6K amplifications have been
     reported in breast cancer, another hormonally driven neoplasm. We assessed
     PS6K dosage in 94 archival paraffin-embedded meningiomas using dual-color
     fluorescence in situ hybridization. We found high-level PS6K
     amplifications in 3 of 22 anaplastic grade III meningiomas. Amplification
     was confirmed by differential polymerase chain reaction in 1 of these
     cases. In contrast, no amplifications were identified in 37 benign (grade
     I) and 35 atypical (grade II) meningiomas. To our knowledge, this
     represents the first report of gene amplification in primary human
     meningiomas. Given its exclusive association with anaplastic meningiomas,
     PS6K amplification likely occurs during the malignant progression of a
     small subset of anaplastic tumors. Further studies are needed to map the
     17q23 amplicon to determine whether additional genes in this region are
     amplified in high-grade meningiomas.

TI  - Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B negatively regulates insulin signaling in
     l6 myocytes and Fao hepatoma cells.
PG  - 10207-11
AB  - Insulin signaling is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the
     signaling molecules, such as the insulin receptor and insulin receptor
     substrates (IRSs). Therefore, the balance between protein-tyrosine kinases
     and protein-tyrosine phosphatase activities is thought to be important in
     the modulation of insulin signaling in insulin-resistant states. We thus
     employed the adenovirus-mediated gene transfer technique, and we analyzed
     the effect of overexpression of a wild-type protein-tyrosine
     phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) on insulin signaling in both L6 myocytes and Fao
     cells. In both cells, PTP1B overexpression blocked insulin-stimulated
     tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 by more than
     70% and resulted in a significant inhibition of the association between
     IRS-1 and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt
     phosphorylation as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase
     phosphorylation. Moreover, insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis was also
     inhibited by PTP1B overexpression in both cells. These effects were
     specific for insulin signaling, because platelet-derived growth factor
     (PDGF)-stimulated PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt
     phosphorylation were not inhibited by PTP1B overexpression. The present
     findings demonstrate that PTP1B negatively regulates insulin signaling in
     L6 and Fao cells, suggesting that PTP1B plays an important role in insulin
     resistance in muscle and liver.

TI  - Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase selectively inhibits
     cell proliferation in human breast cancer cells displaying enhanced
     insulin-like growth factor I-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase
     activation.
PG  - 655-64
AB  - Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase mediates cell proliferation, cell
     differentiation, and cell survival by regulating signaling pathways
     activated by receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs), including the
     insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR). We analyzed the upstream
     signaling components of the MAP kinase pathway, including RPTKs, in human
     breast cancer cell lines and found that some of those components were
     overexpressed. Importantly, signaling molecules such as IGF-IR, insulin
     receptor, and insulin receptor substrate 1, leading to the MAP kinase
     pathway, were found to be concomitantly overexpressed within certain tumor
     lines, i.e., MCF-7 and T-47D. When compared with the nonmalignant and
     other breast tumor lines examined, MCF-7 and T-47D cells displayed a more
     rapid, robust, and sustained MAP kinase activation in response to
     insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) stimulation. By contrast, IGF-I
     treatment led to a sustained down-regulation of MAP kinase in those lines
     overexpressing ErbB2-related RPTKs. Interestingly, blocking the MAP kinase
     pathway with PD098059 had the greatest antiproliferative effect on MCF-7
     and T-47D among the normal and tumor lines tested. Furthermore, addition
     of an IGF-IR blocking antibody to growth medium attenuated the ability of
     PD098059 to suppress the growth of MCF-7 and T-47D cells. Thus, our study
     suggests that concomitant overexpression of multiple signaling components
     of the IGF-IR pathway leads to the amplification of IGF-I-mediated MAP
     kinase signaling and resultant sensitization to PD098059. The enhanced
     sensitivity to PD098059 implies an increased requirement for the MAP
     kinase pathway in those breast cancer cells, making this pathway a
     potential target in the treatment of selected breast malignancies.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein-3 inhibits type 1 IGF
     receptor activation independently of its IGF binding affinity.
PG  - 108-13
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) regulate the cellular
     actions of the IGFs owing to their strong affinities, which are equal to
     or stronger than the affinity of the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF-IR), the
     mediator of IGF signal transduction. We recently found that IGFBP-3
     modulates IGF-I binding to its receptor via a different mechanism possibly
     involving conformational alteration of the receptor. We have now
     investigated the effects of IGFBP-3 on the initial steps in the IGF
     signaling pathway. MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells were preincubated with
     increasing concentrations of IGFBP-3 and then stimulated with IGF-I,
     des(1-3)IGF-I, or [Q(3)A(4)Y(15)L(16)]-IGF-I, the latter two being IGF-I
     analogs with intact affinity for the type 1 IGF receptor, but weak or
     virtually no affinity for IGFBPs. Stimulation of autophosphorylation of
     the receptor and its tyrosine kinase activity was dose-dependently
     depressed. At 2.5 nM, IGFBP-3 provoked more than 50% inhibition of the
     stimulation induced by 3 nM des(1-3)IGF-1 and, at 10 nM, more than 80%
     inhibition. Similar results were obtained with [Q(3)A(4)Y(15)L(16)]-IGF-I.
     Cross-linking experiments using iodinated or unlabeled IGFBP-3 and
     anti-IGF-IR antibodies indicated that the inhibitory effects do not
     involve direct interaction between IGFBP-3 and IGF-IR. The inhibition
     appeared to be specific to IGFBP-3, because IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-5 at 10 nM
     had no significant effect. Also, inhibition was restricted to the IGF
     receptor, because IGFBP-3 failed to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity
     of the insulin receptor stimulated by physiological concentrations of
     insulin. Our results provide the first demonstration that IGFBP-3 can
     specifically modulate the IGF-I signaling pathway independently of its
     IGF-I-binding ability. They also reveal a regulatory mechanism specific to
     the type 1 IGF receptor, with no effect on insulin receptor activation.

     insulin-controlled signaling proteins in livers of male B6C3F1 mice.
PG  - 178-84
AB  - DCA is hepatocarcinogenic in rodents. At carcinogenic doses, DCA causes a
     large accumulation of liver glycogen. Thus, we studied the effects of DCA
     treatment on insulin levels and expression of insulin-controlled signaling
     proteins in the liver. DCA treatment (0.2-2.0 g/l in drinking water for 2
     weeks) reduced serum insulin levels. The decrease persisted for at least 8
     weeks. In livers of mice treated with DCA for 2-, 10-, and 52-week
     periods, insulin receptor (IR) protein levels were significantly
     depressed. Additionally, protein kinase B (PKBalpha) expression decreased
     significantly with DCA treatment. In normal liver, glycogen levels were
     increased as early as at 1 week, and this effect preceded changes in
     insulin and IR and PKBalpha. In contrast to normal liver, IR protein was
     elevated in DCA-induced liver tumors relative to that in liver tissue of
     untreated animals and to an even greater extent when compared to adjacent
     normal liver in the treated animal. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP
     kinase) phosphorylation was also increased in tumor tissue relative to
     normal liver tissue and tissue from untreated controls. These data suggest
     that normal hepatocytes down-regulate insulin-signaling proteins in
     response to the accumulation of liver glycogen caused by DCA. Furthermore,
     these results suggest that the initiated cell population, which does not
     accumulate glycogen and is promoted by DCA treatment, responds differently
     from normal hepatocytes to the insulin-like effects of this chemical. The
     differential sensitivity of the 2 cell populations may contribute to the
     tumorigenic effects of DCA in the liver.

TI  - Differential requirements of the MAP kinase and PI3 kinase signaling
     pathways in Src- versus insulin and IGF-1 receptors-induced growth and
     transformation of rat intestinal epithelial cells.
PG  - 5385-97
AB  - There have been few studies on the specific signaling pathways involved in
     the transformation of epithelial cells by oncogenic protein tyrosine
     kinases. Here we investigate the requirement of MAP (MAPK) and
     phosphatidylinositol 3- (PI3K) kinases in the transformation of rat
     intestinal epithelial (RIE) cells by oncogenic forms of insulin receptor
     (gag-IR), insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (gag-IGFR), and v-Src.
     MAPK is not significantly activated in cells transformed by gag-IR and
     gag-IGFR but is activated in v-Src transformed cells. Treatment with
     PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, at concentrations where MAPK activity was
     reduced below the basal level showed that MAPK is partially required for
     the monolayer growth of parental and transformed RIE cells. However, MAPK
     is not essential for the focus forming ability of the three
     oncogene-transformed cells. It is also not necessary for the colony
     forming ability of gag-IR- and gag-IGFR-, but is partially required for
     v-Src-transformed cells. PI3K is significantly activated in all three
     oncogene transformed RIE cells. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, potently
     inhibited monolayer growth of all three oncogene-transformed cells.
     However, at concentrations of LY294002 where activated forms of Akt, a
     downstream component of the PI3K pathway, were undetectable, colony and
     focus forming abilities of the v-Src-RIE cells were only slightly affected
     whereas those of gag-IR/IGFR-RIE cells were greatly inhibited. These
     results were confirmed using a different pharmacological inhibitor,
     wortmannin, and a dominant negative form of PI3K, Ap85. Similarly,
     rapamycin, known to inhibit p70S6 kinase, a downstream component of the
     PI3K-Akt pathway, also inhibited gag-IR/IGFR-induced, but not
     v-Src-induced, focus and colony formation. We conclude that the MAPK and
     PI3K signaling pathways are differentially required for transformation of
     RIE cells by oncogenic IR and IGFR versus Src and the pattern of
     requirements is different from that of fibroblast transformation.

PG  - 506-13
AB  - The ligands, receptors and related signaling proteins of the insulin-like
     growth factor family are involved in the regulation of breast-cancer cell
     growth. We investigated the expression pattern of insulin-like growth
     factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor
     substrate-1 (IRS-1), a core downstream signaling protein, in 69 primary
     breast-cancer specimens of different grades and in 21 control tissues by
     immunohistochemistry. In addition, cell proliferation (percentage of
     Ki67(+) nuclei) and estrogen receptor (ER) expression were determined.
     IGF-IR, IRS-1 and IR were expressed mainly in epithelial cells. IRS-1 and
     IGF-IR were expressed at high levels in control tissues and in well and
     moderately differentiated carcinomas but at low levels in poorly
     differentiated breast cancers. IR expression did not show a significant
     correlation with the differentiation grade of the tissues investigated.
     Statistical analysis (ROC analysis for tumor grade) demonstrated that
     down-regulation of IGF-IR and IRS-1 correlated better with tumor
     progression than reduction of ER expression or increase in cell
     proliferation, IGF-IR showing the best correlation, followed by IRS-1 and,
     less significant, ER and Ki67. Our findings clearly show that progression
     of breast cancer is accompanied by a reduction of IGF-IR/IRS-1 expression
     and that IGF-IR/IRS-1 expression inversely correlates with high
     proliferation rate in dedifferentiated breast cancers. The strong
     correlation of IGF-IR and IRS-1 down-regulation with tumor progression
     suggests the use of IGF-IR and IRS-1 as a novel set of marker proteins for
     tumor grading.

TI  - Vav3 mediates receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling, regulates GTPase
     activity, modulates cell morphology, and induces cell transformation.
PG  - 9212-24
AB  - A recently reported new member of the Vav family proteins, Vav3 has been
     identified as a Ros receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RPTK) interacting
     protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. Northern analysis shows that Vav3
     has a broad tissue expression profile that is distinct from those of Vav
     and Vav2. Two species of Vav3 transcripts, 3.4 and 5.4 kb, were detected
     with a differential expression pattern in various tissues. Transient
     expression of Vav in 293T and NIH 3T3 cells demonstrated that ligand
     stimulation of several RPTKs (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR],
     Ros, insulin receptor [IR], and insulin-like growth factor I receptor
     [IGFR]) led to tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav3 and its association with
     the receptors as well as their downstream signaling molecules, including
     Shc, Grb2, phospholipase C (PLC-gamma), and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase.
     In vitro binding assays using glutathione S-transferase-fusion
     polypeptides containing the GTPase-binding domains of Rok-alpha, Pak, or
     Ack revealed that overexpression of Vav3 in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in the
     activation of Rac-1 and Cdc42 whereas a deletion mutant lacking the
     N-terminal calponin homology and acidic region domains activated RhoA and
     Rac-1 but lost the ability to activate Cdc42. Vav3 induced marked membrane
     ruffles and microspikes in NIH 3T3 cells, while the N-terminal truncation
     mutants of Vav3 significantly enhanced membrane ruffle formation but had a
     reduced ability to induce microspikes. Activation of IR further enhanced
     the ability of Vav3 to induce membrane ruffles, but IGFR activation
     specifically promoted Vav3-mediated microspike formation. N-terminal
     truncation of Vav3 activated its transforming potential, as measured by
     focus-formation assays. We conclude that Vav3 mediates RPTK signaling and
     regulates GTPase activity, its native and mutant forms are able to
     modulate cell morphology, and it has the potential to induce cell
     transformation.

PG  - C2037-42
AB  - Biotin regulation of asialoglycoprotein receptor expression and insulin
     receptor activity has been established in two human hepatoblastoma cell
     lines, Hep G2 and HuH-7. Second messenger cGMP mimics the effect of biotin
     on asialoglycoprotein receptor expression at the translational level.
     Metabolic labeling and subsequent immunoprecipitation indicate that the
     loss of insulin receptor activity during biotin deprivation was due to
     suppression of receptor synthesis. Evidence for posttranscriptional
     regulation of insulin receptor synthesis was provided by rapid biotin
     induction of receptor synthesis without an increase in gene transcript
     number. Addition of a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) inhibitor
     prevented biotin induction of the insulin and asialoglycoprotein
     receptors, suggesting that protein phosphorylation propagates the cGMP
     signal transduction cascade. Coatomer protein COPI was recently identified
     as the trans-acting factor that regulates in vitro translation of the
     asialoglycoprotein receptor. Biotin repletion of the culture medium
     resulted in the hyperphosphorylation of alpha-COP, which was prevented by
     simultaneous addition of the cGK inhibitor. These findings suggest that
     the end point of this cGMP signal cascade is modulated by cGK and that a
     phosphorylation reaction governs the expression of both receptor proteins.

TI  - Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 protein interacts with the
     insulin-like growth factor-I receptor.
PG  - 38-43
AB  - SOCS proteins are a class of proteins that are negative regulators of
     cytokine receptor signaling via the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer
     and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. In a yeast two-hybrid
     screen of a human fetal brain library, we have previously identified
     SOCS-2 as a binding partner of the activated IGF-I receptor (IGFIR). To
     test whether or not SOCS-3 also binds to the IGFIR, we cloned human SOCS-3
     by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from human skeletal
     muscle mRNA. SOCS-3 mRNA was expressed in many human fetal and adult
     tissues and in some human cancer cell lines (Hela, A549 pulmonary
     adenocarcinoma and G361 human melanoma). We found that human SOCS-3
     protein interacts directly with the cytoplasmic domains of the activated
     IGFIR and the insulin receptor (IR) in the yeast two-hybrid assay. In
     GST-SOCS-3 pull-down experiments using IGFIR from mammalian cells and in
     immunoprecipitation experiments in which IGFIR and FLAG-SOCS-3 were
     transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, we found that
     SOCS-3 interacts constitutively with IGFIR in vitro and in intact cells.
     Unlike SOCS-2, hSOCS-3 was phosphorylated on tyrosines in response to
     IGF-I addition to 293 cells. We conclude that SOCS-3 binds to the IGFIR
     and may be a direct substrate for the receptor tyrosine kinase.

     bronchial epithelial cells: implication for mechanism.
PG  - 2005-10
AB  - Although exposure to asbestos fibers is associated with the development of
     lung cancer, the underlying mechanism(s) remains unclear. Using human
     papillomavirus-immortalized human bronchial epithelial (BEP2D) cells, we
     previously showed that UICC chrysotiles can malignantly transform these
     cells in a stepwise fashion before they become tumorigenic in nude mice.
     In the present study we used cDNA expression arrays to screen
     differentially expressed genes among the tumorigenic cells. A total of 15
     genes were identified, 11 of which were further confirmed by northern
     blot. Expression levels of these genes were then determined among
     transformed BEP2D cells at different stages of the neoplastic process,
     including non-tumorigenic cells that were resistant to serum-induced
     terminal differentiation, early and late passage transformed BEP2D cells,
     five representative tumor cell lines and fused tumorigenic-control cell
     lines which were no longer tumorigenic. A consistent 2- to 3-fold
     down-regulation of the DCC (deleted in colon cancer), Ku70 and heat shock
     protein 27 genes were detected in all the independently generated tumor
     cell lines while expression levels in early transformants as well as in
     the fusion cell lines remained normal. In contrast, all the tumor cell
     lines examined demonstrated 2- to 4-fold overexpression of the insulin
     receptor and its signal transduction genes. Differential expression of
     these genes was completely restored in the fusion cell lines examined. No
     alteration in c-jun or EGF receptor expression was found in any of the
     cell lines. Our data suggest that activation of the insulin receptor
     pathway and inactivation of DCC and Ku70 may cooperate in malignant
     transformation of BEP2D cells induced by asbestos.

     expression and inhibits proliferation of androgen-independent prostate
     cancer cells.
PG  - 5617-20
AB  - Silibinin, a naturally occurring flavonoid antioxidant found in the milk
     thistle, has recently been shown to have potent antiproliferative effects
     against various malignant cell lines, but the underlying mechanism of
     action remains to be elucidated. We investigated the effect of silibinin
     on androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells. At pharmacologically
     achievable silibinin concentrations (0.02-20 microM), we observed
     increased insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3)
     accumulation in PC-3 cell conditioned medium and a dose-dependent increase
     of IGFBP-3 mRNA abundance with a 9-fold increase over baseline at 20
     microM silibinin. An IGFBP-3 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide that
     attenuated silibinin-induced IGFBP-3 gene expression and protein
     accumulation reduced the antiproliferative action of silibinin. We also
     observed that silibinin reduced insulin receptor substrate 1 tyrosine
     phosphorylation, indicating an inhibitory effect on the insulin-like
     growth factor I receptor-mediated signaling pathway. These results suggest
     a novel mechanism by which silibinin acts as an antiproliferative agent
     and justify further work to investigate potential use of this compound or
     its derivatives in prostate cancer treatment and prevention.

TI  - The HIV-1 protease inhibitor indinavir impairs insulin signalling in HepG2
     hepatoma cells.
PG  - 1145-8
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Patients treated with human immunodeficiency virus-1
     protease inhibitors often develop impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes,
     most likely due to an induction of insulin resistance. We therefore
     investigated whether the protease inhibitor indinavir alters insulin
     signalling. METHODS: We incubated HepG2 cells for 48 h without or with
     indinavir (100 micromol/l). Subsequently 125I-insulin binding to the cells
     and the effects of insulin stimulation on insulin-receptor
     substrate-1-phosphorylation, association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
     with insulin-receptor substrate-1 and Akt-Thr308-phosphorylation were
     measured. RESULTS: In cells not exposed to indinavir, insulin (100 nmol/l)
     led to rapid increases of insulin-receptor substrate-1-phosphorylation,
     association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with insulin-receptor
     substrate-1 and Akt-phosphorylation during the first 75 s, followed by
     subsequent decreases. In indinavir-treated cells, these insulin-stimulated
     increases during the first 75 s were reduced by 30-60% and this was not
     associated with alterations in cell number or viability, insulin binding
     to the cells or cellular insulin-receptor substrate-1-content.
     CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Effects of indinavir on initial insulin
     signalling could cause, or contribute to, the metabolic effects of human
     immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated insulin resistance, but not
     dedifferentiation, is abrogated by MEK1/2 inhibitors in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
PG  - 1557-69
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) has been implicated as a
     contributing mediator of insulin resistance observed in pathophysiological
     conditions such as obesity, cancer-induced cachexia, and bacterial
     infections. Previous studies have demonstrated that TNFalpha confers
     insulin resistance by promoting phosphorylation of serine residues on
     insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), thereby diminishing subsequent
     insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. However, little is
     known about which signaling molecules are involved in this process in
     adipocytes and about the temporal sequence of events that ultimately leads
     to TNFalpha-stimulated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. In this study, we
     demonstrate that specific inhibitors of the MAP kinase kinase
     (MEK)1/2-p42/44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway restore
     insulin signaling to normal levels despite the presence of TNFalpha.
     Additional experiments show that MEK1/2 activity is required for
     TNFalpha-induced IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, thereby suggesting a
     mechanism by which these inhibitors restore insulin signaling. We observe
     that TNFalpha requires 2.5-4 h to markedly reduce insulin-triggered
     tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Although TNFalpha
     activates p42/44 MAP kinase, maximal stimulation is observed within 10-30
     min. To our surprise, p42/44 activity returns to basal levels well before
     IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and insulin resistance are observed. These
     activation kinetics suggest a mechanism of p42/44 action more complicated
     than a direct phosphorylation of IRS-1 triggered by the early spike of
     TNFalpha-induced p42/44 activity. Chronic TNFalpha treatment (>> 72 h)
     causes adipocyte dedifferentiation, as evidenced by the loss of
     triglycerides and down-regulation of adipocyte-specific markers. We
     observe that this longer term TNFalpha-mediated dedifferentiation effect
     utilizes alternative, p42/44 MAP kinase-independent intracellular
     pathways. This study suggests that TNFalpha-mediated insulin resistance,
     but not adipocyte dedifferentiation, is mediated by the MEK1/2-p42/44 MAP
     kinase pathway.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor 1 regulates the location, stability, and
     transcriptional activity of beta-catenin.
PG  - 12103-8
AB  - The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) type 1 receptor is required for
     growth, transformation, and protection from apoptosis. IGFs can enhance
     cell migration, which is known to be influenced via regulation of the
     E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex. We sought to investigate whether IGF-1
     modulated the interaction between E-cadherin and beta-catenin in human
     colorectal cancer cells. We used the C10 cell line, which we established
     and have previously shown to lack adenomatous polyposis coli, E-cadherin,
     or beta-catenin mutations. We found that IGF-1 stimulation enhanced
     tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins, beta-catenin and
     insulin-receptor substrate 1, which formed a complex with E-cadherin.
     Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was accompanied by rapid (<1 min)
     dissociation from E-cadherin at the plasma membrane, followed by
     relocation to the cellular cytoplasm. IGF-1 also enhanced the stability of
     beta-catenin protein. Despite this, we observed no enhancement of
     transcriptional activity in complex with T-cell factor 4 (Tcf-4) in human
     embryonic kidney 293 cells treated with IGF-1 or insulin alone. IGF-1 did,
     however, enhance transcriptional activity in combination with lithium
     chloride, an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, which also
     stabilizes beta-catenin. In conclusion, we have shown that IGF-1 causes
     tyrosine phosphorylation and stabilization of beta-catenin. These effects
     may contribute to transformation, cell migration, and a propensity for
     metastasis in vivo.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor I is a dual effector of multiple myeloma cell
     growth.
PG  - 2856-61
AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is an invariably fatal disease that accounts for
     approximately 1% to 2% of all human cancers. Surprisingly little is known
     about the cellular pathways contributing to growth of these tumors.
     Although the cytokine interleukin-6 has been suggested to be the major
     stimulus for myeloma cell growth, the role of a second potential growth
     factor, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), has been less clearly
     defined. The IGF-I signaling cascade in 8 MM cell lines was examined. In 7
     of these, the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) was expressed and autophosphorylated
     in response to ligand. Downstream of IGF-IR, insulin receptor substrate 1
     was phosphorylated, leading to the activation of
     phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI-3K). PI-3K, in turn, regulated 2
     distinct pathways. The first included Akt and Bad, leading to an
     inhibition of apoptosis; the second included the mitogen-activated protein
     kinase (MAPK), resulting in proliferation. Biologic relevance of this
     pathway was demonstrated because in vitro IGF-I induced both an
     antiapoptotic and a proliferative effect. Importantly, in vivo
     administration of IGF-I in SCID mice inoculated with the OPM-2 line led to
     approximately twice the growth rate of tumor cells as in controls. These
     results suggest that IGF-I activates at least 2 pathways effecting myeloma
     cell growth and contributes significantly to expansion of these cells in
     vivo. (Blood. 2000;96:2856-2861)

PG  - 564-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of insulin-receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and
     -2 in ovary dysfunction in women with insulin resistance. DESIGN:
     Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analyses of the localization and
     staining intensity of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in the ovaries of women with the
     polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and gestational diabetes mellitus.
     SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Turku University Central
     Hospital. PATIENT(S): Sections of ovary were obtained at the time of
     cesarean section from five volunteers without medical complications and
     three patients with gestational diabetes mellitus. Paraffin-embedded ovary
     sections were selected from those on file from the department of
     pathology; four were from women with a histologic diagnosis of PCOS and
     seven were from women with endometriosis (controls). INTERVENTION(S):
     None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Protein expression of IRS in human ovary
     samples. RESULT(S): Immunoblotting with specific monoclonal and polyclonal
     antibodies showed the presence of 165-kDa and 183-kDa proteins that
     corresponded to the size of IRS-1 and IRS-2, respectively, in normal
     pregnant ovaries and human cultured follicles. Immunohistochemical
     staining showed that positive IRS-2 expression in antral follicles was
     restricted to theca internal cells in ovulatory ovaries but was
     distributed widely in all compartments of follicles in different stages in
     polycystic ovaries. Compared with follicles at a similar stage of
     development in ovulatory ovaries, follicles in polycystic ovaries showed
     decreased staining for IRS-1 in granulosa cells but increased staining for
     IRS-2 in theca internal cells. These features of IRS-1 and -2 expression
     were also noted in preantral and atretic follicles from patients with
     gestational diabetes mellitus compared with those who had uncomplicated
     pregnancy. CONCLUSION(S): This study highlights a shift of the follicular
     insulin signal protein from IRS-1 to IRS-2 in insulin-resistant states and
     suggests an association between this change and ovarian abnormality in
     PCOS and gestational diabetes mellitus.

     activity in NIH3T3 cells.
PG  - 69-76
AB  - Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A (MEN 2A) is an inherited disease caused by
     mutations of the Ret proto-oncogene. Although many different Ret mutations
     have been described, little is known about the signaling pathways
     triggered by the Ret oncogene. In this study, we have determined the
     signaling properties of a Ret-9bp duplication encoding amino acids
     634-636, which was recently identified in a patient with all clinical
     features of the MEN 2A syndrome. The Ret-9bp duplication leads to
     constitutive activation of the Ret tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, Ret-9bp
     increased mitogenic and transforming activity demonstrated by thymidine
     incorporation as well as colony formation in soft agar. Studying
     intracellular signaling pathways, which may be involved in malignant
     transformation of Ret-9bp expressing NIH3T3 cells, we could demonstrate
     Ret-9bp dependent phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2)
     with consecutive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)
     and protein kinase B (PKB/AKT). Moreover, Ret-9bp induces phosphorylation
     of SHC resulting in growth factor receptor binding protein-2 (Grb-2)
     binding and activation of the mitogen activating protein (MAP) kinase
     pathway. In addition to these postreceptor cytoplasmic signaling events,
     we have studied nuclear signal by Ret-9bp and found activation of c-jun
     and jun-D, two members of the jun/AP-1 family of transcription factors. In
     summary, an oncogenic 9bp duplication of Ret causes Ret dimer formation
     and ligand independent activation of the tyrosine kinase. Besides the
     signaling steps leading to MAPK activation, we could demonstrate that
     Ret-9bp induced constitutive activation of a signaling pathway involving
     IRS-2, PI 3-kinase and PKB/AKT which could transduce the oncogenic Ret
     signal to increased gene transcription via activation of the jun/AP-1
     transcription factor family.

AB  - Insulin resistance is observed in several diseases such as non insulin
     dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).
     To understand genetic determinism of this abnormality we have developed a
     multidisciplinary approach including selection of phenotypes with insulin
     resistance confirmed in vivo by minimal model of Bergman and
     characterization of cellular defects in insulin action on circulating
     erythrocytes and monocytes. Exploration of variability in candidate genes
     by direct sequencing in some genetic syndromes of severe insulin
     resistance and acanthosis nigricans (mainly the Type A syndrome) revealed
     mutations of the insulin receptor gene associated with major defects in
     insulin binding or kinase activity. In other rare genetic syndromes or
     patients affected by NIDDM or PCOS defects appear to be located at
     post-receptor level, where IRS (insulin receptor substrate) genes are the
     most attractive candidates. Prevalence of some allelic variants suggested
     a potential role of IRS genes in insulin resistance, although their
     involvement in the pathogenesis of NIDDM remains controversial.
     Genotype-phenotype correlations in first degree relatives of an index case
     caring the Type A syndrome, suggested that association of allelic variants
     of IRS-1 and IRS-2 with insulin receptor mutations contribute, by
     synergistic effects, to phenotypic expression of defects in signal
     transduction. These mechanisms through genetic epistasis, involving
     several genes in insulin action, fit better with the polygenic nature of
     current forms of NIDDM and represent a good model in the study of
     pathogenesis of insulin resistance.

PG  - 3909-15
AB  - Plasma cell neoplasia in humans generally occurs as multiple myeloma, an
     incurable form of cancer. Tumors with marked similarity can be induced in
     mice by a variety of agents, including chemicals, silicone, and
     oncogene-containing retroviruses, suggesting the use of murine tumors as
     an informative model to study plasma cell disease. Herein, we have focused
     on the role of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling in
     the development of plasma cell disease. The insulin receptor substrate
     2/phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/p70S6K pathway was found to be either
     constitutively or IGF-I-dependently activated in all plasma cell tumors.
     Biological relevance was demonstrated in that plasma cell lines with
     up-regulated IGF-IR expression levels exhibited mitogenic responses to
     IGF-I. More importantly, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of
     IGF-IR in these lines strongly suppressed tumorigenesis in vivo. Taken
     together, these results demonstrate that up-regulation and activation of
     IGF-IR and the downstream signaling pathway involving insulin receptor
     substrate 2, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, and p70S6K may play an
     important role in the development of a broad spectrum of plasma cell
     tumors.

PG  - 1063-70
AB  - In the past several years, extensive studies on the mechanisms underlying
     IL-4 and IL-13 signaling have enabled us to gain insight into how these
     cytokines regulate immune responses. Because both IL-4 and IL-13 use the
     IL-4Ralpha as a receptor component, these cytokines activate many common
     signaling pathways. Both of these cytokines use Janus kinases (JAKs) to
     initiate signaling and activate signal transducer and activator of
     transcription-6 (STAT6), which is a transcription factor required for many
     of their biologic functions. In addition to JAK/STAT, these cytokines also
     activate a variety of other signaling molecules that are important in
     regulating IL-4-induced proliferation and protection from apoptosis.
     Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) is a molecule that can inhibit
     the activation of IL-4 signaling through the inhibition of JAKs. The Fes
     tyrosine kinase is activated by IL-4 and appears to be important in
     regulating IL-4-induced proliferation through the phosphorylation of
     insulin receptor substrate (IRS) molecules. IRS molecules are essential
     for IL-4-induced proliferation through their ability to recruit
     phosphoinositol-3 kinase to the activated IL-4 receptor kinase. In
     addition, IL-4 can activate a number of phosphatases including
     SH2-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP), SHP-1, and SHP-2. Finally,
     B-cell lymphoma gene-6 (BCL-6) appears to regulate a subset of
     IL-4-induced genes. Thus the biologic responses induced by IL-4/IL-13
     require a complex interaction of signaling pathways and regulators.

PG  - 229-35
AB  - Pancreastatin, a chromogranin A-derived peptide widely distributed
     throughout the neuroendocrine system, has a general inhibitory effect on
     endocrine secretion and a counterregulatory effect on insulin action. We
     have recently described the cross-talk of pancreastatin with insulin
     signaling in rat hepatoma cells (HTC), where it inhibits insulin action
     and signaling through the serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor,
     thereby impairing tyrosine kinase activity. Here, we have characterized
     pancreastatin receptors and signaling in HTC cells. The pancreastatin
     effector systems were studied by determining phospholipase C activity in
     HTC membranes and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation
     activity in HTC cells. Binding studies with radiolabeled pancreastatin
     showed a population of high affinity binding sites, with a B(max) of 8
     fmol/mg protein and a K(d) of 0.6 nM. Moreover, we assessed the coupling
     of the receptor with a G protein system by inhibiting the binding with
     guanine nucleotide and by measuring the GTP binding to HTC membranes. We
     found that pancreastatin receptor was coupled with a G alpha(q/11) protein
     which activates phospholipase C-beta(1) and phospholipase C-beta(3), in
     addition to MAPK via both beta gamma and alpha(q/11).

     differentiation of hemopoietic cells.
PG  - 25451-9
AB  - After an initial burst of cell proliferation, the type 1 insulin-like
     growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) induces granulocytic differentiation of
     32D IGF-IR cells, an interleukin-3-dependent murine hemopoietic cell line
     devoid of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). The combined expression of
     the IGF-IR and IRS-1 (32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells) inhibits IGF-I-mediated
     differentiation, and causes malignant transformation of 32D cells. Because
     of the role of IRS-1 in changing the fate of 32D IGF-IR cells from
     differentiation (and subsequent cell death) to malignant transformation,
     we have looked for differences in IGF-IR signaling between 32D IGF-IR and
     32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells. In this report, we have focused on p70(S6K), which
     is activated by the IRS-1 pathway. We find that the ectopic expression of
     IRS-1 and the inhibition of differentiation correlated with a sustained
     activation of p70(S6K) and an increase in cell size. Phosphorylation in
     vivo of threonine 389 and, to a lesser extent, of threonine 421/serine 424
     of p70(S6K) seemed to be a requirement for inhibition of differentiation.
     A role of IRS-1 and p70(S6K) in the alternative between transformation or
     differentiation of 32D IGF-IR cells was confirmed by findings that
     inhibition of p70(S6K) activation or IRS-1 signaling, by rapamycin or
     okadaic acid, induced differentiation of 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells. We have
     also found that the expression of myeloperoxidase mRNA (a marker of
     differentiation, which sharply increases in 32D IGF-IR cells), does not
     increase in 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells, suggesting that the expression of
     IRS-1 in 32D IGF-IR cells causes the extinction of the differentiation
     program initiated by the IGF-IR, while leaving intact its proliferation
     program.

TI  - Stat 5B, activated by insulin in a Jak-independent fashion, plays a role
     in glucokinase gene transcription.
PG  - 1977-88
AB  - Stat proteins are SH2 domain-containing transcription factors that are
     activated by various cytokines and growth factors. In a previous work, we
     have identified Stat 5B as a substrate of the insulin receptor based on
     yeast two-hybrid and mammalian cell transfection studies. In the present
     study, we have approached the biological relevance of the interaction
     between the insulin receptor and the transcription factor Stat 5B.
     Firstly, we show that both insulin and insulin-like growth factor I lead
     to tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat 5B, and this promotes binding of the
     transcription factor to the beta-casein promoter containing a Stat 5
     binding site. Further, we demonstrate that insulin stimulates the
     transcriptional activity of Stat 5B. Activation of Stat 5B by insulin
     appears to be Jak2-independent, whereas Jak2 is required for GH-induced
     Stat 5B activation. Hence the pathway by which Stat 5B is activated by
     insulin is different from that used by GH. In addition, by using Jak1- and
     Tyk2-deficient cells we exclude the involvement of both Jak1 and Tyk2 in
     Stat 5B activation by insulin. Taken together, our results strengthen the
     notion that insulin receptor can directly activate Stat 5B. More
     importantly, we have identified a Stat 5 binding site in the human hepatic
     glucokinase promoter, and we show that insulin leads to a Stat
     5B-dependent increase in transcription of a reporter gene carrying this
     promoter. These observations favor the idea that Stat 5B plays a role in
     mediating the expression of the glucokinase gene induced by insulin. As a
     whole, our results provide evidence for the occurrence of a newly
     identified circuit in insulin signaling in which the cell surface receptor
     is directly linked to nuclear events through a transcription factor.
     Further, we have revealed an insulin target gene whose expression is, at
     least in part, dependent on Stat 5B activation and/or binding.

TI  - The juxtamembrane but not the carboxyl-terminal domain of the insulin
     receptor mediates insulin's metabolic functions in primary adipocytes and
     cultured hepatoma cells.
PG  - 419-32
AB  - Insulin-stimulated signaling pathways are activated upon interactions
     between the intracellular domains of the receptor and its downstream
     effectors. Insulin receptor substrate proteins (IRS-1, -2, -3 and -4) are
     the best-studied substrates for the insulin receptor kinase (IRK). We have
     previously shown that IRS-1 and IRS-2 interact with the juxtamembrane (JM)
     but not with the carboxyl-terminal (CT) region of the insulin receptor
     (IR) in vitro. However, the precise role of these IR regions in mediating
     insulin's bioeffects is still unresolved. In the present work we made use
     of vaccinia virus as a vector for quantitative expression of the JM and CT
     domains within the cytoplasm of physiologically insulin-responsive primary
     rat adipocytes and rat hepatoma Fao cells. We could demonstrate that
     overexpression of either the JM or the CT domains did not inhibit either
     insulin binding or insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation. In
     contrast, metabolic effects such as insulin-induced glucose utilization in
     adipocytes, and insulin-induced amino acid utilization in Fao hepatoma
     cells were inhibited (70-80%) in cells overexpressing the JM but not the
     CT domains of IR. The inhibitory effects of the overexpressed JM domain
     were accompanied by inhibition of insulin-stimulated IRS-1
     phosphorylation, decreased IRS-1-associated PI3K activity, and decreased
     phosphorylation of the downstream effectors of PI3K, PKB and p70 S6K.
     Insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation in Fao cells was also inhibited
     (40%) upon overexpression of the JM but not the CT region of IR. Our
     findings suggest that interactions between the JM region of IR and its
     downstream effectors are obligatory for insulin-stimulated metabolic
     functions in physiologically relevant insulin responsive cells. They also
     rule out the possibility that interaction of proteins, including PI3K,
     with the CT domain can provide an alternative pathway.

     substrate-1 is inhibited by epidermal growth factor in prostate epithelial
     cells.
PG  - 22558-62
AB  - We have sought to determine whether insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)
     regulates the levels of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in prostate
     epithelial cells. Exposure of prostate epithelial cells to IGF-I in the
     absence of other growth factors leads to a reduction in IRS-1 levels.
     Ubiquitin content of IRS-1 is increased in the presence of IGF-I, and
     inhibitors of the proteasome prevented the reduction of IRS-1 levels seen
     following IGF-I exposure. These results imply that IRS-1 is targeted to
     the proteasome upon exposure to IGF-I. The addition of epidermal growth
     factor (EGF) maintained IRS-1 levels even in the presence of IGF-I and
     inhibits IGF-I-dependent ubiquitination of IRS-1. Thus, these two growth
     factors, IGF-I and EGF, had antagonistic effects on IRS-1 protein levels
     in prostate epithelial cells. This regulation of IRS-1 reveals a novel
     level of cross-talk between the IGF-I and EGF signal pathways, which may
     have implications in tumors that harbor activating mutations in the EGF
     receptor.

TI  - Hyperinsulinism and its interaction with hyperandrogenism in polycystic
     ovary syndrome.
PG  - 321-8
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in
     women of reproductive age. It has become increasingly evident that insulin
     resistance plays a significant role both as a cause and result of the
     syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize the possible
     mechanisms leading to insulin resistance and resultant hyperinsulinism
     (HI) and their interaction with hyperandrogenism (HA) in PCOS. We
     conducted a computerized search of MEDLINE for relevant studies in the
     English literature published between January 1966 and January 2000. We
     reviewed all studies that investigated the roles of insulin, insulin
     receptor, and insulin gene in insulin resistance and its interaction with
     hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Insulin resistance in PCOS seems to involve a
     postbinding defect in the insulin receptor and/or in the receptor signal
     transduction. Current research has focused on identifying a genetic
     predisposition for insulin resistance in this syndrome. The answer to the
     question whether HI or HA is the initiating event is still unclear
     inasmuch as there are clinical and molecular evidences to support both of
     these approaches. Our view is that whichever is the triggering insult, a
     vicious cycle is established where HI acts to aggravate HA and vice versa.
     In this model, obesity and genetic predisposition seem to be the
     independent factors that can give rise or contribute to HI, HA, or both
     simultaneously. It seems that "hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism"
     represents a significant subgroup of PCOS, which probably needs to be
     renamed and reclassified in the light of this new approach.

TI  - Evidence for an interaction between the insulin receptor and Grb7. A role
     for two of its binding domains, PIR and SH2.
PG  - 2052-9
AB  - The molecular adapter Grb7 is likely to be implicated in the development
     of certain cancer types. In this study we show that Grb7 binds the insulin
     receptors, when they are activated and tyrosine phosphorylated. This
     interaction is documented by two-hybrid experiments, GST pull-down assays
     and in vivo coimmunoprecipitations. In addition, our results argue in
     favor of a preferential association between Grb7 and the insulin receptors
     when compared to other tyrosine kinase receptors like the EGF receptor,
     the FGF receptor and Ret. Interestingly, Grb7 is not a substrate of the
     insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Grb7 binds the activated
     tyrosine kinase loop of the insulin receptors. Two domains of Grb7 are
     implicated in the insulin receptor binding: the SH2 domain and the PIR
     (phosphotyrosine interacting region). The role of these two domains in the
     interaction with the insulin receptor was already reported for Grb10 and
     Grb14, the other members of the Grb7 family of proteins. However, the
     relative importance of these domains varies, considering the receptor and
     the Grb protein. These differences should be a determinant of the
     specificity of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Grbs binding, and thus of the
     implication of Grb7/10/14 in signal transduction.

     factor I signaling in mammary cancer cells.
PG  - 101-11
AB  - Recent studies have shown that high insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)
     blood level is a risk factor in breast and prostate cancer. The aim of
     this study was to determine whether the mitogenic activity of IGF-I in
     mammary cancer cells can be reduced by the dietary carotenoid lycopene.
     The anticancer activity of lycopene, the major tomato carotenoid, has been
     suggested by in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiological studies. Growth
     stimulation of MCF7 mammary cancer cells by IGF-I was markedly reduced by
     physiological concentrations of lycopene. The inhibitory effects of
     lycopene on MCF7 cell growth were not accompanied by apoptotic or necrotic
     cell death, as determined by annexin V binding to plasma membrane and
     propidium iodide staining of nuclei in unfixed cells. Lycopene treatment
     markedly reduced the IGF-I stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of
     insulin receptor substrate 1 and binding capacity of the AP-1
     transcription complex. These effects were not associated with changes in
     the number or affinity of IGF-I receptors, but with an increase in
     membrane-associated IGF-binding proteins, which were previously shown in
     different cancer cells to negatively regulate IGF-I receptor activation.
     The inhibitory effect of lycopene on IGF signaling was associated with
     suppression of IGF-stimulated cell cycle progression of serum-starved,
     synchronized cells. Moreover, in cells synchronized by mimosine treatment,
     lycopene delayed cell cycle progression after release from the mimosine
     block. Collectively, the above data suggest that the inhibitory effects of
     lycopene on MCF7 cell growth are not due to the toxicity of the carotenoid
     but, rather, to interference in IGF-I receptor signaling and cell cycle
     progression.

TI  - Insulin receptor substrate-1 expression is regulated by estrogen in the
     MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line.
PG  - 12565-71
AB  - Estrogens can stimulate the proliferation of estrogen-responsive breast
     cancer cells by increasing their proliferative response to insulin-like
     growth factors. The mechanism underlying the increased proliferation could
     involve the induction of components of the insulin-like growth factor
     signal transduction pathway by estrogen. In this study we have examined
     the regulation of the expression of insulin receptor substrate-1, a major
     intracellular substrate of the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor
     tyrosine kinase. Estradiol increased insulin receptor substrate-1 mRNA and
     protein levels at concentrations consistent with a mechanism involving the
     estrogen receptor. Insulin receptor substrate-1 was not induced
     significantly by the antiestrogens tamoxifen and ICI 182,780, but they
     inhibited the induction of insulin receptor substrate-1 by estradiol.
     Analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 showed
     that the highest levels were found in cells stimulated by estradiol and
     insulin-like growth factor-I, whereas low levels were found in the absence
     of estradiol irrespective of whether type I insulin-like growth factor
     ligands were present. Insulin receptor substrate-2, -3, and -4 were not
     induced by estradiol. These results suggest that estrogens and
     antiestrogens may regulate cell proliferation by controlling insulin
     receptor substrate-1 expression, thereby amplifying or attenuating
     signaling through the insulin-like growth factor signal transduction
     pathway.

     down-signaling by high glucose in a hepatoma cell line, HepG2 cells.
PG  - 20880-6
AB  - The effects of a high concentration of glucose on the insulin
     receptor-down signaling were investigated in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells
     in vitro to delineate the molecular mechanism of insulin resistance under
     glucose toxicity. Treatment of the cells with high concentrations of
     glucose (15-33 mm) caused phosphorylation of serine residues of the
     insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), leading to reduced electrophoretic
     mobility of it. The phosphorylation of IRS-1 with high glucose treatment
     was blocked only by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors. The high glucose
     treatment attenuated insulin-induced association of IRS-1 and
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of
     Akt. A metabolic effect of insulin, stimulation of glycogen synthesis, was
     also inhibited by the treatment. In contrast, insulin-induced association
     of Shc and Grb2 was not inhibited. Treatment of the cells with high
     glucose promoted the translocation of PKCepsilon and PKCdelta from the
     cytosol to the plasma membrane but not that of other PKC isoforms.
     Finally, PKCepsilon and PKCdelta directly phosphorylated IRS-1 under
     cell-free conditions. We conclude that a high concentration of glucose
     causes phosphorylation of IRS-1, leading to selective attenuation of
     metabolic signaling of insulin. PKCepsilon and PKCdelta are involved in
     the down-regulation of insulin signaling, and they may lie in a pathway
     regulating the phosphorylation of IRS-1.

TI  - Interleukin-4 mediates cell growth inhibition through activation of Stat1.
PG  - 10212-7
AB  - Interleukin-4 (IL-4) activates Stat6 (signal transducer and activator of
     transcription 6) and plays multiple roles in regulation of the immune
     system. IL-4 also triggers phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate
     (IRS), leading to stimulation of cell growth. Moreover, IL-4 inhibits
     proliferation of a variety of cells, but the molecular mechanism of its
     growth inhibitory effect is not understood. In this study, we demonstrated
     that IL-4 inhibited cell growth of colon carcinoma cell lines (HT29 and
     WiDr) but promoted cell growth of Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (BL30 and
     BL41) in a dose-dependent manner. The growth inhibition was not dependent
     on Stat6 activation, because Stat6 was activated at similar levels in all
     cell lines in response to IL-4. Strikingly, IL-4 activated Stat1 in colon
     carcinoma cell lines but not in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Therefore,
     these results suggest that IL-4 induced Stat1 activation, resulting in
     growth inhibition of colon carcinoma cell lines. Importantly, we present
     evidence that Stat1 is necessary for IL-4-mediated growth inhibition using
     Stat1-deficient and Stat1-reconstituted cells. The growth inhibitory
     effect of IL-4 was diminished in Stat1-deficient cells, whereas it was
     restored in Stat1-reconstituted cells. In addition, the expression of
     dominant-negative Stat1 in HT29 cells led to the loss of growth inhibition
     in response to IL-4. Taken together, our data suggest that IL-4 activates
     Stat1, leading to cell growth inhibition in colon cancer cells. Thus, this
     study demonstrates, for the first time, a molecular mechanism by which
     IL-4 inhibits cell growth.

TI  - Multiple signaling pathways mediate interleukin-4-induced
     3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta5-delta4 isomerase type 1 gene
     expression in human breast cancer cells.
PG  - 229-40
AB  - The 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta5-delta4 isomerase (3beta-HSD)
     isoenzymes catalyze an essential step in the formation of all classes of
     active steroid hormones. We have recently shown that 3beta-HSD type 1 gene
     expression is specifically induced by interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 in
     breast human cancer cell lines and in normal human mammary epithelial
     cells in primary culture. There is evidence that IL-4 stimulates
     bifurcating signaling pathways in which the signal transducer and
     activator of transcription-6 (Stat6)-signal pathway is involved in
     differentiation and gene regulation, whereas insulin receptor substrate
     (IRS) proteins mediate the mitogenic action of IL-4. In fact, we have
     shown that Stat6 was activated by IL-4 in all cell lines studied where
     IL-4 induced 3beta-HSD expression, but not in those that failed to respond
     to IL-4. The present study was designed to investigate the potential
     contribution of IRS proteins and their downstream targets to IL-4-induced
     3beta-HSD type 1 gene expression. IL-4 rapidly induced IRS-1 and IRS-2
     phosphorylation in ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cell lines. Moreover,
     insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and insulin, which are well known to
     cause IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation, increased the stimulatory effect of
     IL-4 on 3beta-HSD activity. IRS-1 and IRS-2 are adapter molecules that
     provide docking sites for different SH2-domain-containing proteins such as
     the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. In this light, the inhibition of
     IL-4-induced 3beta-HSD expression by wortmannin and LY294002, two potent
     PI 3-kinase inhibitors, indicates the probable involvement of the PI
     3-kinase signaling molecules in this response to IL-4. Furthermore, it has
     been suggested that the IRS proteins are part of the signaling complexes
     that lead to activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase by
     insulin; thus we investigated the potential role of the MAP kinase (MAPK)
     cascade in the IL-4 action. In ZR-75-1 cells, both the activation of MAPK
     by IL-4 and the IL-4-induced 3beta-HSD activity were completely blocked by
     PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK activation. Wortmannin also blocked MAPK
     activation by IL-4, IGF-I, and insulin, suggesting that the MAPK cascade
     acts as a downstream effector of PI 3-kinases. To further understand the
     cross-talk between signaling pathways involved in IL-4 action, we
     investigated the possible involvement of protein kinase C (PKC). The
     potential role of PKC was suggested by the observation that the well known
     PKC activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) potentiated the
     IL-4-induced 3beta-HSD activity. Taken together, these findings suggest
     the existence of a novel mechanism of gene regulation by IL-4. This
     mechanism would involved the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, which
     transduce the IL-4 signal through a PI 3-kinase- and MAPK-dependent
     signaling pathway. The inability of IGF-I, insulin, and PMA to stimulate
     3beta-HSD expression by themselves in the absence of IL-4 makes obvious
     the absolute requirement of an IL-4-specific signaling molecule. Our
     findings thus suggest that the multiple pathways downstream of IRS-1 and
     IRS-2 must act in cooperation with the IL-4-specific transcription factor
     Stat6 to mediate the induction of 31beta-HSD type 1 gene expression in
     ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor I-induced degradation of insulin receptor
     substrate 1 is mediated by the 26S proteasome and blocked by
     phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibition.
PG  - 1489-96
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a critical adapter protein
     involved in both insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling.
     Due to the fact that alteration of IRS-1 levels can affect the sensitivity
     and response to both insulin and IGF-I, we examined the ability of each of
     these ligands to affect IRS-1 expression. IGF-I (10 nM) stimulation of
     MCF-7 breast cancer cells caused a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of
     IRS-1 that was maximal at 15 min and decreased thereafter. The decrease in
     tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was paralleled by an apparent decrease
     in IRS-1 levels. The IGF-mediated decrease in IRS-1 expression was
     posttranscriptional and due to a decrease in the half-life of the IRS-1
     protein. Insulin (10 nM) caused tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 but not
     degradation, whereas high concentrations of insulin (10 microM) resulted
     in degradation of IRS-1. IGF-I (10 nM) stimulation resulted in transient
     IRS-1 phosphorylation and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)
     activation. In contrast, insulin (10 nM) caused sustained IRS-1
     phosphorylation and ERK activation. Inhibition of 26S proteasome activity
     by the use of lactacystin or MG132 completely blocked IGF-mediated
     degradation of IRS-1. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments
     showed an association between ubiquitin and IRS-1 that was increased by
     treatment of cells with IGF-I. Finally, IGF-mediated degradation of IRS-1
     was blocked by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity but
     was not affected by inhibition of ERK, suggesting that this may represent
     a direct negative-feedback mechanism resulting from downstream IRS-1
     signaling. We conclude that IGF-I can cause ligand-mediated degradation of
     IRS-1 via the ubiquitin-mediated 26S proteasome and a phosphatidylinositol
     3'-kinase-dependent mechanism and that control of degradation may have
     profound effects on downstream activation of signaling pathways.

     factor. In some models, the difference between malignant transformation
     and differentiation (leading to cell death) may depend on the presence or
     absence of a single agonist or antagonist molecule. The type 1
     insulin-like growth factor receptor will serve as the paradigm for this
     review. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppls. 32/33:68-75, 1999.

     activity through glucose transporter 1.
PG  - 72-82
AB  - We evaluated the expression of glucose transporter (glut) isoforms and its
     function in RD cells, human rhabdomyosarcoma, which retain the potential
     to differentiate into muscle. Gluts 1, 3, and 4 were expressed in RD
     cells, as detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and
     immunocytochemistry. Supraphysiological concentration (1 microM) of
     insulin treatment increased 2-deoxy glucose transport by up to 1.68-fold
     together with concomitant tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor
     beta subunit and of insulin receptor substrate 1. Suppression of glut 1
     mRNA by 38% by antisense oligonucleotide transfection led to a reduction
     of basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy glucose transport by 38 and 55%,
     respectively. Suppression of gluts 3 and 4 by antisense oligonucleotide
     transfection did not affect both basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy
     glucose transport. Thus, glut 1 accounts for the major part of basal and
     insulin-stimulated glucose transport in RD cells. Next, we transfected
     expression vectors carrying human gluts 1 and 4 cDNAs into RD cells to add
     further support for the role of glut 1 in glucose transport.
     Overexpression of glut 1 stimulated basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy
     glucose transport by 1.66- and 1.43-fold, respectively. Glut 4
     overexpression did not affect basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy glucose
     transport. Western blot analysis using glut 1 antibody showed that glut 1
     was redistributed from intracellular membrane to plasma membrane. These
     observations support the notion that RD cells, with the potential to
     differentiate into muscle, retain insulin responsiveness. As human muscle
     cell lines are not available at this point, RD cells can serve as a useful
     alternative to human muscle for studies related to insulin signal
     transduction and glucose transport.

TI  - Insulin selectively activates STAT5b, but not STAT5a, via a
     JAK2-independent signalling pathway in Kym-1 rhabdomyosarcoma cells.
PG  - 159-63
AB  - The STAT multigene family of transcriptional regulators conveys signals
     from several cytokines and growth factors upon phosphorylation by janus
     kinases (JAK). Activation of STAT5 is typically mediated by JAK2, but more
     recent data indicate a direct activation by the insulin receptor kinase.
     STAT5 exists in two closely homologous isoforms, STAT5a and b. We here
     describe the selective tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b in Kym-1 cells
     in response to insulin. Blocking insulin signalling by HNMPA-(AM)(3), an
     insulin receptor kinase inhibitor, resulted in the loss of insulin-induced
     STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas the inhibition of JAK2 by the JAK
     selective inhibitor tyrphostin AG490 had no effect. By contrast, in the
     same cells, IFNgamma-induced STAT5b activation was JAK2-dependent,
     indicating that this signal pathway is functional in Kym-1 cells. We
     conclude from this rhabdomyosarcoma model that STAT5b, but not STAT5a is a
     direct target of the insulin receptor kinase.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-dependent activation of pp42/44
     mitogen-activated protein kinase occurs independently of IGF-I receptor
     kinase activation and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation.
PG  - 1147-57
AB  - The proliferation and metabolism of H4IIE hepatoma cells is apparently
     mediated through the insulin receptor. These cells, however, also have
     high-affinity binding sites for insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I).
     Addition of insulin to H4IIE cells increased RNA synthesis, DNA synthesis
     and cell number. IGF-I, on the other hand, was ineffective at
     concentrations equivalent to the lowest effective insulin dose, although
     stimulation was observed with concentrations 100-fold higher. Similar
     results were obtained when glucose uptake was measured. Western blot
     analysis demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation patterns produced by
     insulin and IGF-I differed. In particular, phosphorylation of insulin
     receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) was evident after treatment with insulin, but
     not after treatment with IGF-I. Correspondingly, insulin, but not IGF-I,
     stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase activity. In contrast with these
     results, both insulin and IGF-I induced mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
     kinase phosphorylation and activity at a concentration of 10 nM. The
     correlation between insulin-dependent and IGF-I-dependent MAP kinase
     activation was confirmed by Western blot analysis of phosphorylated MAP
     kinase kinase (MEK). These results suggest that phosphorylation of IRS-1
     is essential for both cell proliferation and glucose metabolism, but is
     uncoupled from the MAP kinase cascade. Furthermore, stimulation of MEK and
     MAP kinase is independent of receptor tyrosine kinase activity.

TI  - Increased activity and expression of MAP kinase in HCC model rats induced
     by 3'-methyl-4-dimethylamino-azobenzene.
PG  - 725-33
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade
     plays an important role not only in the mitogenic signal transduction
     pathway but also in the development of cancer, and it is believed to be
     one of the important regulators in normal hepatocytes and hepatocellular
     carcinoma. The aim of this study was to determine the role of insulin
     receptor substrate-1 and the MAPK cascade in rats with hepatocellular
     carcinoma induced by 3'-methyl-4-dimethylamino-azobenzene (3'-MeDAB).
     METHODS: Liver cancer was induced in rats by feeding 3'-MeDAB, and the
     changes in expression of IRS-1 and MAPK were analyzed in tumorous,
     non-tumorous and control liver. RESULTS: Expression of insulin receptor
     substrate-1 (IRS-1) showed a 1.4-fold increase at protein level in the
     tumors (p<0.01), but the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 did not differ
     between the tumor and control liver. Expression of MAPK and its activity
     were elevated 4.5-7.5-fold (p<0.01) and 4.6-fold (p<0.01) in the tumor
     compared with control liver. In non-tumorous lesions from rats fed with
     3'-MeDAB, expression of MAPK, but not IRS-1, increased significantly
     (p<0.01). Between tumorous and adjacent non-tumorous lesions, there was a
     significant difference in MAPK expression (p<0.05) and activities
     (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The increased expression of MAPK may play an
     important role in the progression or initiation of HCC in this rat model.

     breast cancer cells.
PG  - 280-9
AB  - IGF-responsive breast cancer cells activate insulin receptor substrate
     (IRS)-1 after IGF-I treatment. To determine if IRS-1 expression was
     sufficient to enable IGF-responsiveness, two IGF-I unresponsive breast
     cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-435A and MDA-MB-468) were transfected with
     IRS-1. While IGF-I caused tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in both
     transfected cell lines, increased MAP kinase activity was not seen. IGF-I
     treatment of 435A IRS-1 transfected cells resulted in minimal increased
     PI3 kinase activity associated with IRS-1, while IRS-2/PI3 kinase was
     greatly reduced. In MDA-MB-468 IRS-1 transfected cells, IGF-I caused
     increased IRS-1 associated PI3 kinase activity compared to parental cells,
     but at levels far below those observed in IGF-responsive MCF-7 cells. The
     transfected cells were also not responsive to IGF-I in monolayer growth.
     Thus, IRS-1 expression and activation alone are insufficient to mediate a
     proliferative response to IGF-I in breast cancer cells, and it is likely
     that maximal activation of downstream signaling pathways must also occur.

TI  - Selective insulin resistance in the polycystic ovary syndrome.
PG  - 3110-6
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenemia
     that is amplified by insulin in the presence of resistance to insulin's
     action to stimulate glucose uptake in muscle and fat. To explore the
     mechanisms for this paradox, we examined the metabolic and mitogenic
     actions of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in cultured
     skin fibroblasts from PCOS (n = 16) and control (n = 11) women. There were
     no significant decreases in the number or affinity of insulin- or
     IGF-I-binding sites in PCOS compared to control fibroblasts. Basal rates
     were similar, but there were significant decreases in insulin-stimulated
     (control, 51.8 +/- 7.0; PCOS, 29.5 +/- 2.9 nmol/10(6) cells x 2 h at
     1,000,000 pmol/L; P < 0.005) and IGF-I-stimulated (control, 48.9 +/- 6.7;
     PCOS, 33.0 +/- 3.2 PCOS nmol/10(6) cells x 2 h at 100,000 pmol/L IGF-I; P
     < 0.05) glucose incorporation into glycogen in PCOS fibroblasts, a
     metabolic action of insulin. Stimulation of thymidine incorporation, a
     mitogenic action of insulin, was similar in PCOS and control fibroblasts
     in response to both insulin and IGF-I. There were also no significant
     differences in insulin- or IGF-I-stimulated insulin receptor
     substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activity in PCOS
     compared to control fibroblast cells. We conclude that 1) there is a
     selective defect in insulin action in PCOS fibroblasts that affects
     metabolic, but not mitogenic, signaling pathways; 2) there is a similar
     defect in IGF-I action, suggesting that insulin and IGF-I stimulate
     glycogen synthesis by the same postreceptor pathways; and 3) insulin
     receptor substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation
     by insulin and IGF-I is similar to the control value, suggesting that the
     metabolic signaling defect is in another pathway or downstream of this
     signaling step in PCOS fibroblasts.

PG  - 881-92
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) II is overexpressed in many human cancers
     and is reactivated by, and crucial for viral oncogene (SV40 T antigen,
     [TAg])-induced tumorigenesis in several tumor models. Using a double
     transgenic murine hepatic tumor model, we demonstrate that tissue
     inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) blocks liver hyperplasia during
     tumor development, despite TAg-mediated reactivation of IGF-II. Because
     the activity of IGFs is controlled by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), we
     investigated whether TIMP-1 overexpression altered the IGFBP status in the
     transgenic liver. Ligand blotting showed that IGFBP-3 protein levels were
     increased in TIMP-1-overexpressing double transgenic littermates, whereas
     IGFBP-3 mRNA levels were not different, suggesting that TIMP-1 affects
     IGFBP-3 at a posttranscriptional level. IGFBP-3 proteolysis assays
     demonstrated that IGFBP-3 degradation was lower in TIMP-1-overexpressing
     livers, and zymography showed that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were
     present in the liver homogenates and were capable of degrading IGFBP-3. As
     a consequence of reduced IGFBP-3 proteolysis and elevated IGFBP-3 protein
     levels, dissociable IGF-II levels were significantly lower in
     TIMP-1-overexpressing animals. This decrease in bioavailable IGF-II
     ultimately resulted in diminished IGF-I receptor signaling in vivo as
     evidenced by diminished receptor kinase activity and decreased tyrosine
     phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor downstream effectors, insulin
     receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), extracellular signal regulatory kinase
     (Erk)-1, and Erk-2. Together, these results provide evidence that TIMP-1
     inhibits liver hyperplasia, an early event in TAg-mediated tumorigenesis,
     by reducing the activity of the tumor-inducing mitogen, IGF-II. These data
     implicate the control of MMP-mediated degradation of IGFBPs as a novel
     therapy for controlling IGF bioavailability in cancer.

PG  - 22-32
AB  - The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) plays an important
     role in malignant transformation and in apoptosis. Its role in human
     cancer has now been firmly established. IGF-IR signaling occurs only when
     the receptor is activated by its ligands, which induce autophosphorylation
     of the receptor at several tyrosine residues. Although the IGF-IR
     (phosphorylated or not) can be detected in human cancers with conventional
     antibodies, it would be desirable to obtain antibodies that can detect the
     IGF-IR only when activated by its ligands. We describe and characterize in
     this paper such an antibody and show that it can be used in sections of
     human cancers to detect an autophosphorylated IGF-IR. This antibody will
     be useful in detecting autocrine or paracrine influences on normal and
     tumor cells and could eventually be also useful in diagnostic and
     prognostic studies of human primary and metastatic cancer.

TI  - The Gly972-->Arg amino acid polymorphism in IRS-1 impairs insulin
     secretion in pancreatic beta cells.
PG  - 357-64
AB  - Recent studies have identified several polymorphisms in the human insulin
     receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) gene. The most prevalent IRS-1 variant, a
     Gly-->Arg change at the codon 972, has been reported to be increased in
     prevalence among patients with type 2 diabetes. Carriers of the Arg(972)
     substitution are characterized by lower fasting insulin and C-peptide
     levels compared with non-carriers, suggesting that the Arg(972) IRS-1
     variant may contribute to impairment of insulin secretion. In this study,
     we stably overexpressed both wild-type IRS-1 (RIN-WT) and Arg(972) IRS-1
     variant (RIN-Arg(972)) in RIN beta cells to investigate directly whether
     the polymorphism in codon 972 of IRS-1 impairs insulin secretion. The
     Arg(972) IRS-1 variant did not affect expression or function of endogenous
     IRS-2. RIN-WT showed a marked increase in both glucose- and
     insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 compared with control
     RIN cells. The Arg(972) IRS-1 variant did not alter the extent of either
     glucose- or insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of recombinant
     IRS-1. However, RIN-Arg(972) showed a significant decrease in binding of
     the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) with IRS-1,
     compared with RIN-WT. Compared with control RIN cells, insulin content was
     reduced to the same extent in RIN-WT or RIN-Arg(972) at both the protein
     and mRNA levels. Both glucose- and sulfonylurea-induced insulin secretion
     was increased in RIN-WT compared with control RIN cells. By contrast, RIN
     cells expressing Arg(972) IRS-1 exhibited a marked decrease in both
     glucose- and sulfonylurea-stimulated insulin secretion compared with
     RIN-WT. These data suggest that the insulin signaling pathway involving
     the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase may play an important role in the insulin secretory
     process in pancreatic beta cells. More importantly, the results suggest
     that the common Arg(972) IRS-1 polymorphism may impair glucose-stimulated
     insulin secretion, thus contributing to the relative insulin deficiency
     observed in carriers of this variant.

TI  - Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor overexpression
     in breast cancers leads to insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptor overexpression:
     evidence for a second mechanism of IGF-I signaling.
PG  - 1935-44
AB  - The insulin receptor (IR) form hybrids with the closely related
     insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor (IGF-I-R). Because most
     human breast carcinomas overexpress both the IR and the IGF-I-R, we
     evaluated whether the insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptor (Hybrid-R) is also
     overexpressed in these tumors and what role it plays in breast cancer
     biology. Using specific ELISAs and Western blots, we measured Hybrid-R
     content and function in 8 human cultured breast cancer cell lines and 39
     human breast cancer specimens. Hybrid-R content and function were also
     compared to the content and function of the IR and the IGF-I-R. Hybrid-R
     content exceeded the IGF-I-R content in >75% of breast cancer specimens
     and was directly related to the molar ratio of both the IR and IGF-I-R
     content, suggesting that Hybrid-R formation occurred by random assembly of
     IR and IGF-I-R half-receptors. Hybrid-Rs became tyrosine
     autophosphorylated when breast cancer cells were exposed to IGF-I but not
     when they were exposed to insulin. In cells with an elevated Hybrid-R
     content, Hybrid-R autophosphorylation in response to IGF-I exceeded
     IGF-I-R autophosphorylation, suggesting that most of the IGF-I effect
     occurred via the Hybrid-R. Furthermore, Hybrid-Rs mediated growth in
     response to IGF-I, as indicated by experiments with blocking antibodies to
     the IGF-I-R. These data indicated therefore that: (a) Hybrid-Rs are
     present and play a major role in mediating the IGF-I signal in breast
     cancer; (b) their expression is directly related to IR overexpression; and
     (c) potential therapies designed to block IGF-I actions in breast cancer
     must take into account the role of these Hybrid-Rs.

TI  - Insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors play a major role in IGF-I signaling in
     thyroid cancer.
PG  - 403-7
AB  - The insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) plays an important role in
     determining the biological behavior of a variety of malignancies. We
     measured IGF-I, its receptor and related receptors in thyroid cancer.
     IGF-I was present both in normal thyroid tissue and in thyroid cancer
     tissue and it was produced by stromal cells but not by thyrocytes. Values
     were significantly higher in malignant than in normal tissue. IGF-I
     receptors (IGF-I-Rs) and the homologous insulin receptors (IRs) were found
     overexpressed in both thyroid cancer cell lines (n = 4) and specimens (n =
     17) as compared to normal values. In addition, high levels of hybrid
     IGF-I/insulin receptors (IR/IGF-I-Rs) were present in both thyroid cancer
     specimens and cell lines. IR/IGF-I-R hybrids were the most represented
     type of receptor in 14/17 specimens and exceeded the IGF-I-R content in
     all cases. Hybrid content correlated with the IR and IGF-I-R content,
     suggesting that in thyroid tissue hybrid formation occurs by random
     assembly of IR and IGF-I-R half receptors. Hybrid receptor
     autophosphorylation was stimulated by IGF-I with high affinity. In cells
     with a high IR/IGF-I-Rs content, blocking antibodies specific to these
     receptors substantially inhibited IGF-I induced cell growth. These data
     indicate that the IGF-I system is overactivated in thyroid cancer and that
     IR/IGF-I-R hybrid receptors play an important role in IGF-I mitogenic
     signaling in these tumors.

TI  - The role of TNFalpha and TNF receptors in obesity and insulin resistance.
PG  - 621-5
AB  - Insulin resistance, a smaller than expected response to a given dose of
     insulin, is associated with many common diseases including, ageing,
     polycystic ovarian disease, syndrome X, cancer, infections, trauma and,
     most significantly, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The biochemical
     basis of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes has been the subject of
     many studies. Earlier studies have indicated that quantitative regulation
     of the insulin sensitive glucose transporters (Glut-4) and insulin
     receptors themselves may contribute to this disorder, however, these two
     factors are probably inadequate to explain the extent of insulin
     resistance. This point also became apparent by the development of only
     mild hyperinsulinaemia in mice with a targeted mutation in the Glut-4
     gene. Studies on postreceptor defects in type 2 diabetes has recently
     focused on the intrinsic catalytic activity of the insulin receptor and
     downstream signalling events. A reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of
     both the insulin receptor (IR) and the insulin receptor substrate-1
     (IRS-1) has been noted in both animal and human type 2 diabetes.
     Importantly, this appears to occur in all of the major insulin-sensitive
     tissues, namely the muscle, fat and liver. It is now clear that decreased
     signalling capacity of the insulin receptor is an important component of
     this disease. I will review some of the potential mechanisms underlying
     this deficiency.

     longevity and dauer formation in an insulin receptor-like signaling
     pathway.
PG  - 7427-32
AB  - Inactivation of the tumor suppressor PTEN gene is found in a variety of
     human cancers and in cancer predisposition syndromes. Recently, PTEN
     protein has been shown to possess phosphatase activity on
     phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, a product of
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. We have identified a homolog of PTEN in
     Caenorhabditis elegans and have found that it corresponds to the daf-18
     gene, which had been defined by a single, phenotypically weak allele,
     daf-18(e1375). By analyzing an allele, daf-18(nr2037), which bears a
     deletion of the catalytic portion of CePTEN/DAF-18, we have shown that
     mutation in daf-18 can completely suppress the dauer-constitutive
     phenotype caused by inactivation of daf-2 or age-1, which encode an
     insulin receptor-like molecule and the catalytic subunit of
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, respectively. In addition, daf-18(nr2037)
     dramatically shortens lifespan, both in a wild-type background and in a
     daf-2 mutant background that normally prolongs lifespan. The lifespan in a
     daf-18(nr2037) mutant can be restored to essentially that of wild type
     when combined with a daf-2 mutation. Our studies provide genetic evidence
     that, in C. elegans, the PTEN homolog DAF-18 functions as a negative
     regulator of the DAF-2 and AGE-1 signaling pathway, consistent with the
     notion that DAF-18 acts a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
     phosphatase in vivo. Furthermore, our studies have uncovered a
     longevity-promoting activity of the PTEN homolog in C. elegans.

AB  - Research on insulin action in PCOS has been intensive after the
     identification of insulin resistance as a feature of the syndrome in 1980.
     It is now clear that PCOS is a metabolic as well as a reproductive
     disorder and an important cause of type 2 diabetes mellitus in women. The
     cellular and molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance in PCOS are
     distinct from those in other insulin resistance syndromes. Elucidating
     these mechanisms promises to provide considerable insight into insulin
     receptor signal specificity. Conversely, insulin resistance is now known
     to have an important role in the pathogenesis of the reproductive
     disturbances of PCOS. It is thought that one or several genetic defects
     may cause both the insulin resistance and reproductive abnormalities
     characteristic of PCOS.

     cancer: estrogen regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1 expression in
     vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 787-96
AB  - Cross-talk between insulin-like growth factor (IGF)- and estrogen receptor
     (ER)-signaling pathways results in synergistic growth. We show here that
     estrogen enhances IGF signaling by inducing expression of three key
     IGF-regulatory molecules, the type 1 IGF receptor (IGFR1) and its
     downstream signaling molecules, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and
     IRS-2. Estrogen induction of IGFR1 and IRS expression resulted in enhanced
     tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 after IGF-I stimulation, followed by
     enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. To examine whether
     these pathways were similarly activated in vivo, we examined MCF-7 cells
     grown as xenografts in athymic mice. IRS-1 was expressed at high levels in
     estrogen-dependent growth of MCF-7 xenografts, but withdrawal of estrogen,
     which decreased tumor growth, resulted in a dramatic decrease in IRS-1
     expression. Finally, we have shown that high IRS-1 expression is an
     indicator of early disease recurrence in ER-positive human primary breast
     tumors. Taken together, these data not only reinforce the concept of
     cross-talk between IGF- and ER-signaling pathways, but indicate that IGF
     molecules may be critical regulators of estrogen-mediated growth and
     breast cancer pathogenesis.

PG  - 5896-904
AB  - In this study, we used maleimidobutyrylbiocytin to examine possible
     alteration that may occur in the redox state of the insulin receptor (IR)
     sulfhydryl groups in response to reduced glutathione (GSH) or
     N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Short-term treatment of intact cells expressing
     large numbers of IR with GSH or NAC led to a rapid and reversible
     reduction of IR alpha-subunit disulfides, without affecting the receptor
     beta-subunit thiol reactivity. The overall integrity of the oligomeric
     structure of IR was maintained, indicating that neither class I nor class
     II disulfides were targeted by these agents. Similar findings were
     obtained in cells transfected with IR mutants lacking cysteine524, one of
     the class I disulfides that link the two IR alpha-subunits.
     Membrane-associated thiols did not participate in GSH- or NAC-mediated
     reduction of IR alpha-subunit disulfides. No difference in insulin binding
     was observed in GSH-treated cells; however, ligand-mediated increases in
     IR autophosphorylation, tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates,
     and dual phosphorylation of the downstream target mitogen-activated
     protein kinase were inhibited at concentrations of GSH (10 mM or greater)
     that yielded a significant increase in IR alpha-subunit thiol reactivity.
     GSH did not affect IR signaling in the absence of insulin. Our results
     provide the first evidence that the IR alpha-subunit contains a select
     group of disulfides whose redox status can be rapidly altered by the
     reducing agents GSH and NAC.

PG  - 32-5
AB  - Insulin regulates hepatocellular metabolism and growth following insulin
     receptor (IR) autophosphorylation and activation of the intracellular
     adapter protein, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). IRS-1 activates SH2
     domain proteins such as Grb2, which may be vital to hepatocyte growth. To
     determine if these substances are abnormally expressed under
     pathophysiologic conditions, IR, IRS-1, Grb2 protein, and IR mRNA were
     studied in normal human liver (n = 10), cirrhotic liver (n = 10), and
     hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n = 10) that had been procured during
     operative procedures. IR mRNA was quantified by S1-nuclease assay using a
     195-bp digoxigenin-labeled IR DNA probe and normalized to the level of
     expression of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene.
     Protein concentrations were determined by immunoblot analysis following
     SDS-PAGE of liver homogenate samples. Labeled DNA and antibody-complexed
     protein were detected by chemiluminescent means and quantified by
     densitometric analysis (mean densitometric units +/- standard error).
     Similar levels of IR mRNA were observed in normal tissue, cirrhosis, and
     HCC. IR protein concentration was significantly greater in HCC than in
     normal liver (1.82 +/- 0.2 vs 1. 25 +/- 0.17; P < 0.05). IRS-1 was
     significantly increased in cirrhosis compared to normal liver (1.61 +/-
     0.31 vs 0.86 +/- 0.21; P < 0.05). No differences were observed in Grb2 in
     the three tissue types. Insulin receptor overexpression, previously seen
     in other tumor types, may confer an insulin-mediated growth advantage in
     HCC if added receptors reflect functional high affinity binding sites.
     Although an altered mass of IRS-1 protein was not observed in HCC, an
     IRS-1 increase in cirrhosis may favor hepatic regeneration.

TI  - Regulation of dauer larva development in Caenorhabditis elegans by daf-18,
     a homologue of the tumour suppressor PTEN.
PG  - 329-32
AB  - The tumour suppressor gene PTEN (also called MMAC1 or TEP1) is somatically
     mutated in a variety of cancer types [1] [2] [3] [4]. In addition,
     germline mutation of PTEN is responsible for two dominantly inherited,
     related cancer syndromes called Cowden disease and
     Bannayan-Ruvalcaba-Riley syndrome [4]. PTEN encodes a dual-specificity
     phosphatase that inhibits cell spreading and migration partly by
     inhibiting integrin-mediated signalling [5] [6] [7]. Furthermore, PTEN
     regulates the levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) by
     specifically dephosphorylating position 3 on the inositol ring [8]. We
     report here that the dauer formation gene daf-18 is the Caenorhabditis
     elegans homologue of PTEN. DAF-18 is a component of the insulin-like
     signalling pathway controlling entry into diapause and adult longevity
     that is regulated by the DAF-2 receptor tyrosine kinase and the AGE-1 PI
     3-kinase [9]. Others have shown that mutation of daf-18 suppresses the
     life extension and constitutive dauer formation associated with daf-2 or
     age-1 mutants. Similarly, we show that inactivation of daf-18 by
     RNA-mediated interference mimics this suppression, and that a wild-type
     daf-18 transgene rescues the dauer defect. These results indicate that
     PTEN/daf-18 antagonizes the DAF-2-AGE-1 pathway, perhaps by catalyzing
     dephosphorylation of the PIP3 generated by AGE-1. These data further
     support the notion that mutations of PTEN contribute to the development of
     human neoplasia through an aberrant activation of the PI 3-kinase
     signalling cascade.

TI  - Insulin receptor isoform A, a newly recognized, high-affinity insulin-like
     growth factor II receptor in fetal and cancer cells.
PG  - 3278-88
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is a peptide growth factor that is
     homologous to both insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin and
     plays an important role in embryonic development and carcinogenesis.
     IGF-II is believed to mediate its cellular signaling via the transmembrane
     tyrosine kinase type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-I-R),
     which is also the receptor for IGF-I. Earlier studies with both cultured
     cells and transgenic mice, however, have suggested that in the embryo the
     insulin receptor (IR) may also be a receptor for IGF-II. In most cells and
     tissues, IR binds IGF-II with relatively low affinity. The IR is expressed
     in two isoforms (IR-A and IR-B) differing by 12 amino acids due to the
     alternative splicing of exon 11. In the present study we found that IR-A
     but not IR-B bound IGF-II with an affinity close to that of insulin.
     Moreover, IGF-II bound to IR-A with an affinity equal to that of IGF-II
     binding to the IGF-I-R. Activation of IR-A by insulin led primarily to
     metabolic effects, whereas activation of IR-A by IGF-II led primarily to
     mitogenic effects. These differences in the biological effects of IR-A
     when activated by either IGF-II or insulin were associated with
     differential recruitment and activation of intracellular substrates. IR-A
     was preferentially expressed in fetal cells such as fetal fibroblasts,
     muscle, liver and kidney and had a relatively increased proportion of
     isoform A. IR-A expression was also increased in several tumors including
     those of the breast and colon. These data indicate, therefore, that there
     are two receptors for IGF-II, both IGF-I-R and IR-A. Further, they suggest
     that interaction of IGF-II with IR-A may play a role both in fetal growth
     and cancer biology.

TI  - Insulin receptor substrate 1 is a target for the pure antiestrogen ICI
     182,780 in breast cancer cells.
PG  - 299-304
AB  - The pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 inhibits insulin-like growth factor
     (IGF)-dependent proliferation in hormone-responsive breast cancer cells.
     However, the interactions of ICI 182,780 with IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR)
     intracellular signaling have not been characterized. Here, we studied the
     effects of ICI 182,780 on IGF-IR signal transduction in MCF-7 breast
     cancer cells and in MCF-7-derived clones overexpressing either the IGF-IR
     or its 2 major substrates, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) or
     src/collagen homology proteins (SHC). ICI 182,780 blocked the basal and
     IGF-I-induced growth in all studied cells in a dose-dependent manner;
     however, the clones with the greatest IRS-1 overexpression were clearly
     least sensitive to the drug. Pursuing ICI 182,780 interaction with IRS-1,
     we found that the antiestrogen reduced IRS-1 expression and tyrosine
     phosphorylation in several cell lines in the presence or absence of IGF-I.
     Moreover, in IRS-1-overexpressing cells, ICI 182,780 decreased IRS-1/p85
     and IRS-1/GRB2 binding. The effects of ICI 182,780 on IGF-IR protein
     expression were not significant; however, the drug suppressed
     IGF-I-induced (but not basal) IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation. The
     expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC as well as SHC/GRB binding
     were not influenced by ICI 182,780. In summary, downregulation of IRS-1
     may represent one of the mechanisms by which ICI 182,780 inhibits the
     growth of breast cancer cells. Thus, overexpression of IRS-1 in breast
     tumors could contribute to the development of antiestrogen resistance.

TI  - Modulation of insulin receptor signalling by pancreastatin in HTC hepatoma
     cells.
PG  - 317-25
AB  - Pancreastatin, a neuropeptide derived from chromogranin A, has a
     glycogenolytic and counterregulatory effect to insulin in the rat liver.
     This effect is mediated by calcium and protein kinase C activity. Our aim
     was to study the possible cross-talk between pancreastatin and the insulin
     signalling system, by using the well-studied insulin sensitive rat
     hepatoma HTC cells. First, we checked the counterregulatory effect of
     pancreastatin on insulin action. Pancreastatin dose-dependently inhibited
     insulin stimulated glycogen synthesis. This effect was not due to
     competition for insulin receptors. Moreover, when protein kinase C
     activation was blocked with staurosporine, this effect of pancreastatin
     was not observed. Next, we found a dose-dependent inhibition of insulin
     receptor autophosphorylation by pancreastatin. In addition,
     phosphorylation of the major substrates of insulin receptor in HTC, i. e.
     insulin-receptor substrate (IRS)-1/IRS-2 and p62 was also blunted and so
     was its association with p85 regulatory subunit of
     phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. Moreover, the insulin activation of S6
     kinase was also blocked by pancreastatin. Again, all these inhibitory
     effects of pancreastatin were prevented by staurosporine. Furthermore,
     pancreastatin produced Ser/Thr phosphorylation of insulin receptor by a
     staurosporine-sensitive mechanism. Finally, we checked the pancreastatin
     activation of protein kinase C in HTC cells and found that a "classical"
     isoform of this protein is translocated to the plasma membrane. These
     findings suggest that pancreastatin could exert its anti-insulin effect in
     the hepatocyte by interrupting the stimulation of early insulin receptor
     signalling as a result of phosphorylation. This interaction might have a
     role in the mechanisms of insulin resistance.

TI  - Concerted activity of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and focal adhesion kinase
     in regulation of cell motility.
PG  - 3125-35
AB  - The coordinated interplay of substrate adhesion and deadhesion is
     necessary for cell motility. Using MCF-7 cells, we found that insulin-like
     growth factor I (IGF-I) induces the adhesion of MCF-7 to vitronectin and
     collagen in a dose- and time-dependent manner, suggesting that IGF-I
     triggers the activation of different integrins. On the other hand, IGF-I
     promotes the association of insulin receptor substrate 1 with the focal
     adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2,
     resulting in FAK and paxillin dephosphorylation. Abrogation of SHP-2
     catalytic activity with a dominant-negative mutant (SHP2-C>S) abolishes
     IGF-I-induced FAK dephosphorylation, and cells expressing SHP2-C>S show
     reduced IGF-I-stimulated chemotaxis compared with either mock- or SHP-2
     wild-type-transfected cells. This impairment of cell migration is
     recovered by reintroduction of a catalytically active SHP-2.
     Interestingly, SHP-2-C>S cells show a larger number of focal adhesion
     contacts than wild-type cells, suggesting that SHP-2 activity participates
     in the integrin deactivation process. Although SHP-2 regulates
     mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, the mitogen-activated protein
     kinase kinase inhibitor PD-98059 has only a marginal effect on MCF-7 cell
     migration. The role of SHP-2 as a general regulator of cell chemotaxis
     induced by other chemotactic agents and integrins is discussed.

     elegans by a homolog of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene.
PG  - 2925-30
AB  - The human PTEN tumor suppressor gene is mutated in a wide variety of
     sporadic tumors. To determine the function of PTEN in vivo we have studied
     a PTEN homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans. We have generated a strong
     loss-of-function allele of the PTEN homolog and shown that the deficient
     strain is unable to enter dauer diapause. An insulin-like
     phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3'K) signaling pathway regulates
     dauer-stage entry. Mutations in either the daf-2 insulin receptor-like
     (IRL) gene or the age-1 encoded PI3'K catalytic subunit homolog cause
     constitutive dauer formation and also affect the life span, brood size,
     and metabolism of nondauer animals. Strikingly, loss-of-function mutations
     in the age-1 PI3'K and daf-2 IRL genes are suppressed by loss-of-function
     mutations in the PTEN homolog. We establish that the PTEN homolog is
     encoded by daf-18, a previously uncloned gene that has been shown to
     interact genetically with the DAF-2 IRL AGE-1 PI3'K signaling pathway.
     This interaction provides clear genetic evidence that PTEN acts to
     antagonize PI3'K function in vivo. Given the conservation of the PI3'K
     signaling pathway between C. elegans and mammals, the analysis of daf-18
     PTEN mutant nematodes should shed light on the role of human PTEN in the
     etiology of metabolic disease, aging, and cancer.

TI  - Insulin activates G alpha il,2 protein in rat hepatoma (HTC) cell
     membranes.
PG  - 142-7
AB  - Insulin action is initiated by binding to its cognate receptor, which then
     triggers multiple cellular responses by activating different signaling
     pathways. There is evidence that insulin receptor signaling may involve G
     protein activation in different target cells. We have studied the
     activation of G proteins in rat hepatoma (HTC) cells. We found that
     insulin stimulated binding of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)
     (GTP-gamma-35S) to plasma membrane proteins of HTC cells, in a
     dose-dependent manner. This effect was completely blocked by pertussis
     toxin treatment of the membranes, suggesting the involvement of G proteins
     of the G alpha i/G alpha o family. The expression of these G alpha
     proteins was checked by Western blotting. Next, we used blocking
     antibodies to sort out the specific G alpha protein activated by insulin
     stimulation. Anti-G alpha il,2 antibodies completely prevented
     insulin-stimulated GTP binding, whereas anti-G alpha o,i3 did not modify
     this effect of insulin on GTP binding. Moreover, we found physical
     association of the insulin receptor with G alpha il,2 by copurification
     studies. These results further support the involvement of a pertussis
     toxin-sensitive G protein in insulin receptor signaling and provides some
     evidence of specific association and activation of G alpha il,2 protein by
     insulin. These findings suggest that G alpha il,2 proteins might be
     involved in insulin action.

TI  - C-terminal Src kinase associates with ligand-stimulated insulin-like
     growth factor-I receptor.
PG  - 5422-8
AB  - Increased expression of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR)
     protein-tyrosine kinase occurs in several kinds of cancer and induces
     neoplastic transformation in fibroblast cell lines. The transformed
     phenotype can be reversed by interfering with the function of the IGF-IR.
     The IGF-IR is required for transformation by a number of viral and
     cellular oncoproteins, including SV40 large T antigen, Ras, Raf, and Src.
     The IGF-IR is a substrate for Src in vitro and is phosphorylated in
     v-Src-transformed cells. We observed that the IGF-IR and IR associated
     with the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) following ligand stimulation. We
     found that the SH2 domain of CSK binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated form
     of IGF-IR and IR. We determined the tyrosine residues in the IGF-IR and in
     the IR responsible for this interaction. We also observed that fibroblasts
     stimulated with IGF-I or insulin showed a rapid and transient decrease in
     c-Src tyrosine kinase activity. The results suggest that c-Src and CSK are
     involved in IGF-IR and IR signaling and that the interaction of CSK with
     the IGF-IR may play a role in the decrease in c-Src activity following

AB  - Chronic ethanol toxicity impairs liver regeneration, inhibits DNA
     synthesis, and mutes cellular responses to growth factor stimulation.
     Previous studies demonstrated that the adverse effects of ethanol are
     mediated by inhibition of tyrosyl phosphorylation of the insulin receptor
     and the insulin receptor substrate-type 1 (IRS-1). However, overexpression
     of IRS-1 leads to increased DNA synthesis and cellular transformation due
     to constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. The
     present study examines the effects of ethanol on insulin signaling through
     IRS-1 in FOCUS hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which overexpress IRS-1, to
     determine whether such cells were resistant to the inhibitory effects of
     ethanol. The results demonstrated that ethanol treatment (100 mM) caused
     30 to 50% reductions in the levels of insulin-stimulated tyrosyl
     phosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta-subunit, tyrosyl
     phosphorylation of IRS-1, phosphorylation of Erk2, association of
     phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase with tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS-1, and MAP
     kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activities. In contrast, ethanol
     treatment had no effect on epidermal growth factor-stimulated tyrosyl
     phosphorylation of Shc. Corresponding with the pronounced inhibition of
     MAP kinase, ethanol treatment resulted in 30 to 50% reductions in the
     expression levels of two important insulin-responsive genes:
     glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and proliferating cell
     nuclear antigen (PCNA). The findings suggest that, in FOCUS hepatocellular
     carcinoma cells, which overexpress IRS-1, ethanol treatment substantially
     inhibits IRS-1 and MAP kinase signaling and growth-associated gene
     expression, but has no effect on Shc phosphorylation, which activates
     p21ras through an IRS-1 independent pathway.

PG  - 315-9
AB  - Cross-talk between steroid hormones and polypeptide growth factors
     regulates the growth of hormone-responsive breast cancer cells. For
     example, in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, insulin up-regulates
     estrogen receptor (ER) content and binding capacity. Since the insulin
     receptor (IR) substrate 1 (IRS-1) is one of the core signaling elements
     transmitting mitogenic and metabolic effects of insulin, we investigated
     whether IRS-1 is also required for the insulin-induced function of the ER.
     The effects of insulin on the ER were compared in MCF-7 cells and
     MCF-7-derived cell lines with decreased levels (by approximately 80%) of
     IRS-1 due to the expression of IRS-1 antisense RNA. The severe IRS-1
     deficiency in MCF-7 cells was associated with (1) reduced mitogenic
     response to 20 ng/ml insulin and 10% calf serum (CS), but not to 1 nM
     estradiol (E2); (2) loss of insulin-E2 synergism; (3) up-regulation of ER
     protein expression and binding capacity; and (4) loss of insulin-induced
     regulation of ER tyrosine phosphorylation. In conclusion, the data confirm
     the existence of the IR-ER cross-talk and suggest that IRS-1-dependent
     signaling may contribute to the negative regulation of the ER expression
     and function in MCF-7 cells.

     with over-feeding and sedentary life style?
PG  - 589-601
AB  - Almost two decades of research have greatly increased our knowledge in the
     complex field of metabolic aberrations in polycystic ovary syndrome, but
     still many problems remain unsolved. The statistical association between
     insulin levels and androgens originally put the focus on possible direct
     cause-and-effect relationships between these factors. Indeed there is
     evidence that insulin may affect ovarian functions in multiple ways,
     presumably in some cases causing anovulation and hyperandrogenism.
     Clearly, insulin may increase biologically active testosterone through
     reducing SHBG levels. Conversely, major increases in androgen levels may
     induce muscular changes leading to reduced insulin-mediated glucose
     uptake. There are suggestions of increased steroidogenesis in both ovarian
     and adrenal pathways, with the net result of increased androgen
     production. There are also findings supporting increased corticosteroid
     production, which could contribute to insulin resistance directly or
     through promoting accumulation of abdominal fat, a typical feature of
     over-weight women with PCOS. Free fatty acids, released in great amounts
     from abdominal fat, may induce insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may
     also be due to a primary aberration in the insulin receptor. Putatively
     increased serine phosphorylation may cause both impairment of the insulin
     signal and increased 17,20 lyase activity, thus suggesting a common cause
     for insulin resistance and increased androgen production. There are also
     findings supporting a high prevalence of beta-cell dysfunction in PCOS,
     ranging from increased insulin secretion, not explained by insulin
     resistance or BMI, to failing beta-cell function, mainly in obese women
     during progress to glucose intolerance and NIDDM. Recent genetic findings
     also support a multifactorial genesis to PCOS, notably with positive
     findings both in genes regulating steroidogenesis and insulin secretion.
     It is suggested that PCOS is the result of "thrifty" genes, providing
     advantages in times of shortage of nutrition such as muscular strength,
     moderate abdominal fatness and decreased insulin sensitivity, i.e. an
     anabolic, energy saving constitution. However, when this constitution is
     exposed to unlimited food supplies and modern sedentary life style a
     full-blown PCOS with insulin resistance and infertility is triggered,
     presumably via several mechanisms, which follow a logical amplification
     system between two basic anabolic hormones, insulin and testosterone.

TI  - Insulin receptor substrate 2 and Shc play different roles in insulin-like
     growth factor I signaling.
PG  - 34543-50
AB  - The major substrates for the type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I)
     receptor are Shc and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. In the
     current study, we report that IGF-I induces a sustained tyrosine
     phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2 in SH-SY5Y human
     neuroblastoma cells. The time course of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation
     parallels the time course of IGF-I-stimulated activation of extracellular
     signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Transfection of SH-SY5Y cells with a p52
     Shc mutant decreases Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc-Grb2
     association. This results in the inhibition of IGF-I-mediated ERK tyrosine
     phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth. In contrast, IGF-I induces a
     transient tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 and an association of IRS-2
     with Grb2. The time course of IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and
     IRS-2-Grb2 and IRS-2-p85 association closely resembles the time course of
     IGF-I-mediated membrane ruffling. Treating cells with the
     phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 blocks
     IGF-I-induced membrane ruffling. The ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059, as well
     as transfection with the p52 Shc mutant, has no effect on IGF-I-mediated
     membrane ruffling. Immunolocalization studies show IRS-2 and Grb2, but not
     Shc, concentrated at the tip of the extending growth cone where membrane
     ruffling is most active. Collectively, these results suggest that the
     association of Shc with Grb2 is essential for IGF-I-mediated neurite
     outgrowth, whereas the IRS-2-Grb2-phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase complex
     may regulate growth cone extension and membrane ruffling.

     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma
     cells.
PG  - 4881-9
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a potent neurotropic factor
     promoting the differentiation and survival of neuronal cells. SH-SY5Y
     human neuroblastoma cells are a well characterized in vitro model of
     nervous system growth. We report here that IGF-I stimulated the tyrosine
     phosphorylation of the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor
     substrate-2 (IRS-2) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. These
     cells lacked IRS-1. After being tyrosine phosphorylated, IRS-2 associated
     transiently with downstream signaling molecules, including
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) and Grb2. Treatment of the cells
     with PI 3-K inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) increased IGF-I-induced
     tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2. We also observed a concomitant increase
     in the mobility of IRS-2, suggesting that PI 3-K mediates or is required
     for IRS-2 serine/threonine phosphorylation, and that this phosphorylation
     inhibits IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Treatment with PI 3-K inhibitors
     induced an increased association of IRS-2 with Grb2, probably as a result
     of the increased IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, even though the
     PI 3-K inhibitors enhanced the association of Grb2 with IRS-2, these
     compounds suppressed IGF-I-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase
     activation and neurite outgrowth. Together, these results indicate that
     although PI 3-K participates in a negative regulation of IRS-2 tyrosine
     phosphorylation, its activity is required for IGF-IR-mediated
     mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and neurite outgrowth.

TI  - Protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha regulates Src family kinases and alters
     cell-substratum adhesion.
PG  - 31890-900
AB  - The roles of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in processes such as
     cell growth and adhesion are poorly understood. To explore the ability of
     specific PTPs to regulate cell signaling pathways initiated by stimulation
     of growth factor receptors, we expressed the receptor-like PTP, PTPalpha,
     in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. These cells express high levels of the
     epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and proliferate in response to the
     autocrine production of transforming growth factor-alpha. Conversely, EGF
     stimulation of A431 cells in vitro leads to growth inhibition and triggers
     the rapid detachment of these cells from the substratum. Although PTPalpha
     expression did not alter the growth characteristics of either unstimulated
     or EGF-stimulated cells, this phosphatase was associated with increased
     cell-substratum adhesion. Furthermore, PTPalpha-expressing A431 cells were
     strikingly resistant to EGF-induced cell rounding. Overexpression of
     PTPalpha in A431 cells was associated with the
     dephosphorylation/activation of specific Src family kinases, suggesting a
     potential mechanism for the observed alteration in A431 cell-substratum
     adhesion. Src kinase activation was dependent on the D1 catalytic subunit
     of PTPalpha, and there was evidence of association between PTPalpha and
     Src kinase(s). PTPalpha expression also led to increased association of
     Src kinase with the integrin-associated focal adhesion kinase, pp125(FAK).
     In addition, paxillin, a Src and/or pp125(FAK) substrate, displayed
     increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in PTPalpha-expressing cells
     and was associated with elevated amounts of Csk. In view of these
     alterations in focal adhesion-associated molecules in PTPalpha-expressing
     A431 cells, as well as the changes in adhesion demonstrated by these
     cells, we propose that PTPalpha may have a role in regulating
     cell-substratum adhesion.

PG  - 1030-5
AB  - Herbimycin A is widely used as an inhibitor of Src family protein tyrosine
     kinases but is also reported to induce the downregulation of epidermal
     growth factor (EGF) receptor number in A431 cells without inhibiting its
     tyrosine kinase activity. To determine the specificity of the receptor
     downregulation, we examined its effect on a variety of cell lines which
     express different levels of EGF receptor and on other tyrosine kinase
     receptors. Long-term herbimycin A treatment decreased the amounts of all
     the tyrosine kinase receptors examined in a dose-dependent manner. It also
     reduced ligand-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation in accordance with
     the reduction in the receptor level. Herbimycin A inhibited platelet
     derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular
     proteins and DNA synthesis in NIH3T3 cells but did not affect the
     serum-stimulated DNA synthesis. PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and
     activation of c-Src was inhibited but the protein level of c-Src was not
     reduced by herbimycin A. The reduced level of c-Src kinase activity
     correlated with the levels of both PDGF receptor and DNA synthesis. These
     results indicate that the herbimycin A treatment selectively downregulates
     receptor tyrosine kinases, independent of the number of receptors, and
     suggest that c-Src is to some degree involved in the selective inhibition
     of PDGF-induced mitogenesis by herbimycin A.

PG  - 813-21
AB  - Deregulated signal transduction via the epidermal growth factor (EGF)
     receptor family of tyrosine protein kinase growth factor receptors is
     associated with proliferative diseases such as cancer and psoriasis. In an
     attempt to selectively block signal transduction from the EGF receptor, we
     have synthesized a new class of dianilino-phthalimide tyrosine protein
     kinase inhibitors with selectivity for the EGF receptor tyrosine protein
     kinase. 4, 5-Dianilino-phthalimide (DAPH 1) was metabolized in vitro by
     mouse liver fractions and in vivo. The major metabolite has been
     identified as 4-(4-hydroxyanilino)-5-anilino-phthalimide. To specifically
     block this biotransformation (hydroxylation), we have synthesized
     4,5-bis(4-fluoroanilino)phthalimide (DAPH 2), a potent and selective EGF
     receptor tyrosine protein kinase inhibitor. DAPH 2 inhibits the EGF
     receptor and protein kinase C beta2 enzymes with equal potency. In cells,
     DAPH 2 inhibits signal output from the EGF receptor, but not from other
     classes of receptor protein tyrosine kinases, such as the platelet-derived
     growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, insulin-like
     growth factor I receptor, and insulin receptor. Selective antitumor
     activity was demonstrated in vivo at well-tolerated doses in mice. This
     publication describes the biological profile of DAPH 2 and investigates
     its cellular and in vivo mechanism of action.

     and transformation.
PG  - 1429-36
AB  - The synergistic action of estrogens and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)
     promotes the growth of many human breast cancer cell lines. This
     synergistic effect involves estrogen-dependent induction of the IGF
     system, i.e., estrogens augment the number of IGF-I receptors, stimulate
     the secretion of IGF-II, and promote the synthesis of certain IGF-binding
     proteins. On the other hand, the sustained activation of the IGF-I
     receptor (IGF-IR) by the overexpression of IGF-II has been found to
     contribute to the development of the estrogen-independent phenotype in
     breast cancer cells. In this study, we have investigated whether the
     amplification of the IGF-IR intracellular signaling in MCF-7 cells can
     abolish or reduce estrogen requirements for growth and transformation. To
     this end we developed several MCF-7 clones that overexpressed insulin
     receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), one of the principal substrates of the
     IGF-IR. We report here that in MCF-7 cells overexpressing IRS-1, estrogen
     requirements for growth in monolayer culture as well as in soft agar were
     reduced. The decreased estrogen requirements depended on the level of the
     overexpressed IRS-1 protein, and in cells which contained several-fold
     more functional IRS-1 than the parental cells, we observed total loss of
     estrogen dependence for growth. In addition, the importance of IRS-1 in
     proliferation of MCF-7 cells has been confirmed through the use of
     antisense strategies.

     substrate-1 in breast cancer: correlation with clinical parameters and
     disease-free survival.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) interact with specific cell surface
     receptors to mediate cell growth. Intracellular effects of the IGFs are
     mediated by activation of secondary messenger molecules. One of these
     proteins, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), is phosphorylated after
     type I IGF receptor activation and has a major role in IGF signaling.
     Receptor activation also is influenced by high-affinity IGF binding
     proteins (IGFBPs). In serum, IGFBP-3 is the predominant species. The role
     of IGFBP-3 in the regulation of breast cancer cell growth is unclear; both
     growth inhibition and stimulation have been documented in tissue culture
     systems. To investigate the influence of IGFBP-3 and IRS-1 in breast
     cancer, we measured levels of these proteins by ELISA and immunoblotting
     in 195 node-negative primary human breast cancers and compared their
     levels with known prognostic factors and disease-free survival (DFS).
     IGFBP-3 levels correlated positively with tumor size (r = 0.27, P <
     0.0001) and negatively with estrogen receptor (r = -0.35, P < 0. 0001) and
     progesterone receptor (r = -0.16, P = 0.021). In contrast, IRS-1 did not
     correlate with prognostic factors, but higher levels of IRS-1 predicted
     worse DFS for the subset of patients with tumors </=2 cm (P = 0.04), and
     for patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, there was a trend
     toward worse DFS (P = 0.06). These results suggest that higher tumor
     levels of IGFBP-3 are associated with worse features in breast cancer.
     However, IGFBP-3 was not an independent prognostic factor. In contrast,
     high levels of IRS-1 in the tumors predicted a higher incidence of
     recurrence, suggesting that IRS-1-mediated signaling in breast tumors may
     be involved in the growth regulation of breast cancer.

TI  - Focal adhesion kinase and its potential involvement in tumor invasion and
     metastasis.
PG  - 745-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Integrins are cell surface receptors which, in part, mediate
     the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix. In addition to
     providing a molecular "glue" essential for tissue organization and
     survival, integrins are dynamic signaling molecules. Integrins allow
     normal, nontransformed cells to sense that they are adhered to the
     extracellular matrix, thus providing a cell survival signal. This signal
     allows cells to proliferate in the presence of growth factors and in some
     instances prevents apoptosis. Integrins also mediate cell migration as it
     occurs in normal processes such as angiogenesis, wound healing, immune
     system function, and development. Aberrances in the expression and
     function of integrins contribute to many disease states including cancer.
     RESULTS: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) becomes phosphorylated and activated
     during integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Focal adhesion kinase is a signal
     transducer of integrins (and certain soluble growth factors). Cells
     derived from FAK -/- mouse embryos exhibit reduced migration relative to
     wild-type cells. Cells which overexpress FAK show increased migration
     relative to wild-type cells. Focal adhesion kinase promotes cell survival
     under certain in vitro conditions. Focal adhesion kinase is overexpressed
     in invasive and metastatic colon, breast, thyroid, and prostate cancers.
     Enhanced FAK immunostaining is detected in small populations of
     preinvasive (carcinoma in situ) oral cancers and in large populations of
     cells in invasive oral cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Focal adhesion kinase is
     probably not a classical oncogene but may be involved in the progression
     of cancer to invasion and metastasis. It is hypothesized that
     overexpression of FAK in subpopulations of tumor cells leads to
     populations of cells with a high propensity toward invasion and
     metastasis. Focal adhesion kinase would have a dual role in this regard:
     Overexpression of FAK leads to (1) increased cell migration and (2)
     increased cell survival under anchorage-independent conditions. Further
     work is needed to test this model and to determine whether FAK represents
     a viable target for anticancer therapy.

TI  - Enhanced expression of the insulin receptor substrate-2 docking protein in
     human pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 4250-4
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) is a multisite docking protein
     implicated in mitogenic signaling after activation of the insulin and
     insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptors. In the present study, we
     characterized IRS-2 expression and function in human pancreatic cancer.
     IRS-2 mRNA and protein were expressed in ASPC-1 and COLO-357 human
     pancreatic cancer cell lines. Insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II enhanced the
     growth of both cell lines, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2,
     and increased IRS-2-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase
     activity. The mitogenic effects of insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II were
     markedly attenuated by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002. Northern blot
     analysis of total RNA extracted from normal and cancerous tissues revealed
     that IRS-2 mRNA levels were increased in the cancer tissues (P = 0.032).
     In the normal pancreas, IRS-2 immunoreactivity was present at low levels
     in some ductal and acinar cells and at moderate levels in a heterogeneous
     pattern in all of the endocrine islets. In the pancreatic cancers, IRS-2
     was abundant in the ductal-like cancer cells. These findings indicate that
     IRS-2 is overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer and suggest that it may
     contribute to enhanced mitogenic signaling via the PI 3-kinase pathway,
     thereby leading to excessive growth stimulation in this malignancy.

TI  - Lack of insulin resistance in fibroblasts from subjects with polycystic
     ovary syndrome.
PG  - 940-6
AB  - Insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by
     a novel defect in insulin signal transduction expressed in isolated human
     adipocytes as impaired insulin sensitivity for glucose transport and
     antilipolysis. To determine whether this is a generalized defect of a
     potentially genetic basis, or possibly a tissue-specific one, fibroblast
     cultures were established from age- and weight-matched obese normal
     cycling (NC; n = 5) and PCOS (n = 6) subjects. Adipocytes from the current
     PCOS subjects displayed impaired sensitivity for glucose transport
     stimulation (half-maximal effective concentration [EC50], 317 +/- 58
     pmol/L in PCOS v 130 +/- 40 in NC; P < .025). Specific insulin binding was
     similar in fibroblasts from NC (0.57% +/- 0.10%/10(6) cells) and PCOS
     (0.45% +/- 0.10%) subjects. Fibroblasts from NC (4.9- +/- 0.5-fold
     stimulation) and PCOS (4.6- +/- 0.3-fold) subjects were equally responsive
     to insulin for stimulation of glucose incorporation into glycogen. Insulin
     sensitivity for glycogen synthesis in fibroblasts did not differ between
     NC (EC50, 9.6 +/- 0.9 nmol/L) and PCOS (9.1 +/- 0.9) cells. For thymidine
     incorporation into DNA, relative insulin responsiveness was similar in NC
     (2.3- +/- 0.3-fold stimulation) and PCOS (2.1- +/- 0.1-fold) fibroblasts.
     Insulin sensitivity for DNA synthesis was similar in NC (EC50, 12.9 +/-
     2.4 nmol/L) and PCOS (7.6 +/- 1.3) cells. In summary, (1) insulin receptor
     binding is normal in PCOS fibroblasts; and (2) PCOS fibroblasts have
     normal insulin sensitivity and responsiveness for metabolic and mitogenic
     responses. Impaired insulin signal transduction, while present in
     adipocytes from a group of PCOS subjects, is not found in fibroblasts from
     the same subjects. This defect is not generalized to all cell types, but
     may be limited to specific tissues and responses.

     kinases such as c-Src and c-Yes have been shown to be up-regulated in some
     human colon cancers. To evaluate the activity of these kinases in human
     colorectal carcinomas, we examined colon cancers and adjacent normal
     intestinal mucosa from 11 patients. Moderate increases in ERK and JNK
     activities, in addition to up-regulation of c-Src, p125FAK, and
     tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, were observed in a subset of the
     colorectal carcinomas. There was a significant correlation found between
     levels of c-Src, p125FAK, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, as well as
     between c-Src protein levels and JNK activity. This is the first report
     that examines several different kinases as markers to characterize
     colorectal cancers in the same carcinoma sample, allowing the
     determination of correlations between markers in the same tumors.

TI  - Insulin-stimulated cell growth in insulin receptor substrate-1-deficient
     ZR-75-1 cells is mediated by a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-independent
     pathway.
PG  - 268-80
AB  - In many human breast cancers and cultured cell lines, insulin receptor
     expression is elevated, and insulin, via its own insulin receptor, can
     stimulate cell growth. It has recently been demonstrated that the enzyme
     phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K) mediates various aspects of insulin
     receptor signaling including cell growth. In order to understand the
     mechanisms for insulin-stimulated cell growth in human breast cancer, we
     measured insulin-stimulable PI3-K activity in a non-transformed breast
     epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, and in two malignantly transformed cell
     lines, ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB157. All three cell lines express comparable
     amounts of insulin receptors whose tyrosine autophosphorylation is
     increased by insulin, and in these cell lines insulin stimulates growth.
     In MDA-MB157 and MCF-10A cells, insulin stimulated PI3-K activity three-
     to fourfold. In ZR-75-1 cells, however, insulin did not stimulate PI3-K
     activity. In ZR-75-1 cells PI3-K protein was present, and its activity was
     stimulated by epidermal growth factor, suggesting that there might be a
     defect in insulin receptor signaling upstream of PI3-K and downstream of
     the insulin receptor. Next, we studied insulin receptor substrate-1
     (IRS-1), a major endogenous substrate for the insulin receptor which, when
     tyrosine is phosphorylated by the insulin receptor, interacts with and
     activates PI3-K. In ZR-75-1 cells, there were reduced levels of protein
     for IRS-1. In these cells, both Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and
     mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K) activity were increased by the
     insulin receptor (indicating that the p21ras pathway may account for
     insulin-stimulated cell growth in ZR-75-1 cells). The PI3-K inhibitor
     LY294002 (50 microM) reduced insulin-stimulated growth in MCF-10A and
     MDA-MB157 cell lines, whereas it did not modify insulin effect on ZR-75-1
     cell growth. The MAP-K/Erk (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 (50 microM)
     consistently reduced insulin-dependent growth in all three cell lines.
     Taken together, these data suggest that in breast cancer cells insulin may
     stimulate cell growth via PI3-K-dependent or-independent pathways.

     and its inhibition by Fc gamma RIIB1-BCR coligation.
PG  - 684-91
AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that the Src homology 2-containing
     tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) plays an important role in signal
     transduction through receptor tyrosine kinase and cytokine receptors. In
     most models, SHP-2 appears to be a positive mediator of signaling.
     However, coligation of Fc gamma RIIB1 with B cell Ag receptors (BCR)
     inhibits BCR-mediated signaling by a mechanism that may involve
     recruitment of phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, and the SH2 containing inositol
     5'phosphatase (SHIP) to the phosphorylated Fc gamma RIIB1 immunoreceptor
     tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. The role of SHP-2 in BCR-mediated cell
     activation and in Fc gamma RIIB1-mediated inhibitory signaling is unclear.
     In this study we assessed the association of SHP-2 with
     phosphotyrosine-containing cellular protein(s) before and after
     stimulation through these receptors. BCR stimulation induced the
     association of SHP-2 with a single major tyrosyl-phosphorylated molecule
     (pp120) that had an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa. Coligation of Fc
     gamma RIIB1 with BCR led to a rapid decrease in SHP-2 association with
     pp120. Analysis of the subcellular localization of pp120 showed that the
     complex of SHP-2 and tyrosyl-phosphorylated p120 occurs predominantly in
     the cytosol. Furthermore, the binding of the two molecules was mediated by
     the interaction of tyrosyl-phosphorylated p120 with the SHP-2 N-terminal
     SH2 domain. These findings indicate that SHP-2 and pp120 function in BCR
     signaling, and this function may be inhibited by Fc gamma RIIB1 signaling.

TI  - A specific increased expression of insulin receptor substrate 2 in
     pancreatic beta-cell lines is involved in mediating serum-stimulated
     beta-cell growth.
PG  - 1074-85
AB  - Certain nutrients and growth factors can stimulate pancreatic beta-cell
     growth. However, the appropriate mitogenic signaling pathways in
     beta-cells have been relatively undefined. In this study, differential
     gene expression in NEDH rat insulinoma was compared with NEDH rat primary
     islet beta-cells. Differential mRNA display analysis revealed an elevated
     expression in insulinoma of VL30 transposons, S24 ribosomal protein, and
     cytochrome-C oxidaseVIIc that is typical for cells undergoing mitosis. A
     gene candidate approach revealed that mRNA levels of the oncogenes c-fos
     and c-jun were equivalently expressed in insulinoma and islet cells, as
     was the mRNA for the mitogenic signal transduction molecule insulin
     receptor substrate (IRS)-1. However, in contrast to that of IRS-1, IRS-2
     gene expression was 60- to 70-fold higher in the insulinoma tissue
     compared with islets, which was reflected at the protein as well as the
     mRNA level. The specific elevated IRS-2 expression was a consistent
     observation across all rodent pancreatic beta-cell lines. To investigate
     whether IRS-2 was functional, serum-stimulated beta-cell proliferation was
     examined in isolated insulinoma cells. After a 48-h period of serum
     withdrawal, 24 h of serum refeeding rendered an 8- to 10-fold increase in
     [3H]thymidine incorporation into insulinoma cells. This serum-stimulated
     DNA synthesis was prevented by inhibitors of tyrosine protein kinase and
     phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activities, as well as the activation
     of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and p70S6K. Examination of
     IRS-mediated signal transduction pathways indicated that after 10-15 min
     of serum refeeding, there was increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2
     and pp60, and PI 3-kinase recruitment to IRS-2. Serum also increased the
     association of growth factor-bound protein 2/murine sons of sevenless 1
     protein to a PI 3-kinase/IRS-2 protein complex. Moreover, serum also
     activated MAP-kinase (erk-1 and erk-2 isoforms) and 70 kD S6 kinase. Thus
     IRS-mediated signal transduction pathways are functional in pancreatic

TI  - Divergent pathways regulate ligand-independent activation of ER alpha in
     SK-N-BE neuroblastoma and COS-1 renal carcinoma cells.
PG  - 835-41
AB  - The alpha-estrogen receptor (ER alpha) transcriptional activity can be
     regulated either by binding to the cognate ligand or by intracellular
     signaling pathways responsive to a variety of factors acting through cell
     membrane receptors. Studies carried out in HeLa and COS-1 cells
     demonstrated that the cross-coupling between estrogen and growth factor
     receptors is mediated by p21ras and requires phosphorylation of a specific
     serine residue (Ser 118 in the human ER alpha and Ser 122 in mouse ER
     alpha) located in the ER alpha N-terminal activation function 1 (AF-1).
     Likewise, in the SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cell line p21ras is involved in the
     cross-coupling between insulin and ER alpha receptors. However, in this
     cell line Ser 122 is not necessary for insulin-dependent activation of
     unliganded ER alpha. In addition, after insulin activation, the
     electrophoretic mobility associated to serine hyperphosphorylation of ER
     alpha in SK-N-BE and in COS-1 cells is different. Our study rules out the
     possibility of tyrosine phosphorylation in unliganded ER alpha activation
     by means of transactivation studies of ER alpha tyrosine mutants and
     analysis of Tyr phosphorylation immunoreactivity. The two cofactors for
     steroid receptors RIP 140 and SRC-1 do not seem to be specifically
     involved in the insulin-induced ER alpha transactivation. The present
     study demonstrates the possibility of an alternative, cell-specific
     pathway of cross-coupling between intracellular and membrane receptors,
     which might be of importance for the understanding of the physiological
     significance of this mode of activation in the nervous system.

AB  - To determine whether insulin stimulates human ovarian testosterone
     production in the polycystic ovary syndrome by activating its own receptor
     and using inositolglycan mediators as the signal transduction system,
     thecal cells from polycystic ovary syndrome women were isolated and
     cultured. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I stimulated thecal
     testosterone biosynthesis. Antibody blockade of the insulin receptor
     abolished insulin's stimulatory action, whereas effective antibody
     blockade of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor did not alter
     insulin's stimulation of thecal testosterone biosynthesis. A
     chiro-inositol containing glycan (INS-2) increased thecal testosterone
     biosynthesis. Preincubation of cells with an antiinositolglycan antibody
     (A23939 or alpha IGP) abolished insulin's stimulatory effect, but not that
     of hCG. These findings suggest that inositolglycans serve as the signal
     transduction system for insulin's stimulation of human thecal testosterone
     biosynthesis.

TI  - Insulin receptor substrate 1 antisense expression in an hepatoma cell line
     reduces cell proliferation and induces overexpression of the Src homology
     2 domain and collagen protein (SHC).
PG  - 177-86
AB  - In mammalian cells, the insulin receptor substrate 1 protein (IRS-1) is a
     specific substrate for insulin and IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinases which
     is involved in mediating metabolic and mitogenic actions of insulin and
     IGFs. In order to determine if IRS-1 is also essential in a chicken
     derived hepatoma cell line (LMH cells), IRS-1 gene has been invalidated in
     these cells. For this, we subcloned chicken IRS-1 gene in an antisense
     orientation into a mammalian expression vector driven by the
     cytomegalovirus early promoter. LMH cells were stably transfected with
     this construct or with the empty vector carrying only the neomycin
     resistance gene and selected for cIRS-1 expression. One subclone, C2,
     showed a complete repression of cIRS-1 expression at both protein and mRNA
     levels. Proliferation of C2 cells was dramatically reduced (54%) compared
     with Neo(r) cells. Furthermore this reduction was accompanied by a
     decrease in insulin-dependent [3H]thymidine incorporation, indicating a
     reduction in DNA synthesis. Insulin-dependent [U-14C]glucose incorporation
     into cellular lipids was also significantly reduced in C2 cell line
     suggesting an alteration in lipogenesis. In wild type LMH cells, SHC which
     is involved in Ras pathway, also served as a substrate for insulin
     receptor tyrosine kinase. In C2 cells, SHC expression, its association
     with the insulin receptor and its tyrosine phosphorylation were largely
     increased. Two forms of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase were
     present: p85 and p55 forms. Furthermore, C2 cells displayed increased
     basal phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3'-kinase activity. This report
     demonstrates a role for cIRS-1 in the metabolic and mitogenic actions of
     insulin in LMH cells. However, the overexpression of cIRS-1 antisense did
     not completely abolish cell proliferation. This may be explained by the
     exacerbation of an alternative pathway that only partly compensate for the
     knocking out of cIRS-1 gene: the overexpression of SHC.

TI  - Insulin receptor substrate-1 is the predominant signaling molecule
     activated by insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin, and interleukin-4 in
     estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cells.
PG  - 9994-10003
AB  - Because insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin, and interleukin-4
     (IL-4) have known biological effects in breast cancer cells and signal
     through insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) adaptor proteins, we examined the
     expression and function of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in breast tumors and cell
     lines. IRS-1 and IRS-2 were expressed by cell lines and primary breast
     tumor specimens. IGF-I, insulin, and IL-4 treatment of MCF-7 and ZR-75,
     and IGF-I treatment of T47-D breast cancer cells, resulted in much greater
     tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 compared with IRS-2. Furthermore, IGF-I
     stimulated greater tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 than either insulin
     or IL-4. IGF-I treatment also enhanced association of the p85 regulatory
     subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with IRS-1 and stimulated
     increased enzymatic activity compared with IL-4 and insulin in all three
     cell lines. Similarly, mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was
     greater in IGF-I-stimulated cells. To determine the functional
     significance of the activation of these pathways, we inhibited activation
     of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with wortmannin and mitogen-activated
     protein kinase with PD098059. Both compounds inhibited IGF-stimulated
     growth, suggesting that both pathways contributed to the mitogenic
     response to IGF-I. We conclude that IRS-1, and not IRS-2, is the
     predominant signaling molecule activated by IGF-I, insulin, and IL-4.
     Furthermore, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by IGF-I, compared
     with either insulin or IL-4, is associated with greater activation of
     mitogenic downstream signaling pathways resulting in enhanced cell growth.

TI  - A role for the insulin-interleukin (IL)-4 receptor motif of the IL-4
     receptor alpha-chain in regulating activation of the insulin receptor
     substrate 2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6
     pathways. Analysis by mutagenesis.
PG  - 9898-905
AB  - The interleukin (IL)-4 receptor alpha-chain (IL-4Ralpha) contains a
     sequence motif (488PLVIAGNPAYRSFSD) termed the insulin IL-4 receptor motif
     (I4R motif). Mutation of the central Tyr497 to Phe blocks the tyrosine
     phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and diminishes
     proliferation in response to IL-4. Recent data suggest that the I4R motif
     encodes binding sites for several protein tyrosine binding (PTB)
     domain-containing proteins such as IRS1 and Shc and potentially for the
     Src homology 2 domain of signal transducer and activator of transcription
     6 (STAT6). To analyze the function of the I4R motif in regulating IL-4
     signaling, we changed conserved residues upstream and downstream of the
     central Tyr to Ala in the human IL-4Ralpha. We analyzed the ability of
     these constructs to signal the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and STAT6,
     the induction of DNA binding activity, and CD23 induction in response to
     human IL-4 (huIL-4) in transfected M12.4.1 cells. Mutagenesis of residues
     downstream of Tyr497, such as Arg498 or Phe500, to Ala had no effect on
     any of these responses, suggesting that the I4R motif may not be important
     for functional Src homology 2 domain interactions. However, mutagenesis of
     Pro488 to Ala (P488A) greatly diminished the tyrosine phosphorylation of
     IRS2 and abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6, induction of DNA
     binding activity, and CD23 induction in response to huIL-4. By contrast, a
     P488G mutant signaled these responses to huIL-4. Mutagenesis of
     hydrophobic amino acids previously shown to contact the PTB domain of
     IRS1, Leu489 or Ile491, to Ala had only minimal effects on responses to
     huIL-4. However, changing both Leu498 and Ile491 to Ala greatly diminished
     the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and abolished STAT6 activation. Taken
     together, these results indicate the important role of the I4R motif in
     regulating IRS docking and suggest that I4R docking to a PTB
     domain-containing protein regulates activation of the STAT6 pathway.

     cell line RINm5F is associated with phosphorylation of the insulin-like
     growth factor-I receptor and the insulin receptor substrate-2.
PG  - 573-81
AB  - A proliferative effect of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) was
     previously shown in pancreatic islets. However, the mechanism under which
     IGF-I actions are exerted in insulin-secreting cells is not clear. The rat
     insulinoma cell line, RINm5F, was shown to have both IGF-I receptors and
     IGF-Il/mannose-6-phosphate receptors. IGF-I binding to cell surface
     receptors stimulated phosphorylation of 97 kDa and 93 kDa subunits of the
     IGF-I receptor and incorporation of [3H]thymidine into RINm5F cells. Both
     the IGF-I-induced protein phosphorylation and [3H]thymidine incorporation
     were abolished in the presence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
     genistein. Under basal conditions, IGF-I did not induce insulin release or
     changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. Immunoprecipitation of
     proteins from RINm5F cells, using phosphotyrosine antibodies, followed by
     western blotting using antibody against IRS-1 revealed no distinct band of
     phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1. Instead,
     tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-2 was detected and stimulated by IGF-I when
     western blotting was performed using antibody against IRS-2. These results
     indicate that IRS-1 is not likely to be involved in IGF-I signalling in
     RINm5F cells. Hence, IGF-I stimulated DNA synthesis in RINm5F cells was
     associated with phosphorylation of IGF-I receptors and IRS-2.

     complexes.
PG  - 2392-8
AB  - The insulin receptor, following insulin stimulation of cells, triggers
     formation of various signaling complexes. In rat HTC hepatoma cells
     overexpressing normal human insulin receptors (HTC-IR), p85 regulatory
     subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) forms signaling complexes
     containing the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1),
     guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (GAP) and 60-70 kDa
     phosphotyrosine proteins (p60-70). In the present study, we demonstrate
     that p60-70 interacts directly with the p85 subunit via src homology 2
     domain of the latter. Employing antibodies specific to two p85 isoforms,
     p85alpha and p85beta, we demonstrate that HTC-IR cells express both p85
     isoforms, and these isoforms induce the formation of similar signaling
     complexes in response to insulin. p60-70, present in both alpha-p85alpha
     and alpha-p85beta immunoprecipitates, is a GAP-associated protein, but is
     distinct from the p68 src-associated protein in mitosis (Sam68) by several
     criteria. These data suggest that 1) GAP-associated protein, but not
     Sam68, is a part of insulin signaling complexes; and 2) p85alpha and
     p85beta form similar, but distinct, insulin receptor signaling complexes.

TI  - Interactions between the oestrogen and insulin-like growth factor
     signalling pathways in the control of breast epithelial cell
     proliferation.
PG  - 35-44
AB  - There is increasing evidence for interactions between steroid and growth
     factor signalling pathways. Oestrogens modulate the responsiveness of
     breast epithelial cells to insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), and this
     may be the mechanism by which oestrogens modulate cell proliferation.
     Oestrogens appear to act at several points in the IGF signal transduction
     pathway. Despite earlier studies suggesting that breast epithelial cells
     do not synthesize IGF-I, we have shown by PCR that IGF-I is expressed and
     that its expression is regulated by oestrogen. IGF-II is expressed at
     markedly higher levels than IGF-I and is also regulated by oestrogen,
     consistent with it being an oestrogen-regulated autocrine growth factor.
     Oestrogens regulate the expression of IGF binding proteins and the type I
     IGF receptor. The biological significance of oestrogen regulation of IGF
     binding protein expression is not clear. Experiments in which the type I
     IGF receptor has been constitutively overexpressed have suggested that
     oestrogen regulation of the receptor is not involved in mediating the
     effects of oestrogen on cell proliferation. Recent studies have started to
     assess the effects of oestrogen on the expression of components of the IGF
     signal transduction pathway, and have shown that the expression of insulin
     receptor substrate-1, the principal substrate for the tyrosine kinase of
     the type I IGF receptor, is regulated by oestradiol.

TI  - Insulin receptor substrate-1 is expressed at high levels in all cells of
     the peri-implantation mouse embryo.
PG  - 386-93
AB  - Insulin and insulinlike growth factors are important for embryonic growth
     and metabolism. Intracellular transduction for these factors has not been
     studied in the preimplantation mouse embryo. Peri-implantation mouse
     embryos synthesize insulinlike growth factor (IGF)-II ligand, insulin
     receptor, IGF-I receptor, and IGF-II receptor and respond to IGF-II,
     IGF-I, and insulin metabolically and mitogenically. Maternal tissues in
     the oviduct and uterus are also sources of IGF-I and insulin. Signaling of
     IGFs occurs through insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2. This
     paper shows that IRS-1 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in
     preimplantation mouse embryos, in embryonic cell lines, and in cultured
     blastocyst outgrowths. IRS-1 mRNA and protein are detected in
     embryo-derived cell lines cultured to produce the three cell lineages
     (stem cells, endoderm, and trophoblast cells). IRS-1 mRNA is detected by
     reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the E3.5
     blastocyst before implantation and in F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells and
     parietal endoderm cells. IRS-1 mRNA is detected by Northern blot
     hybridization at high levels in stem cells and in differentiated progeny
     of F9 cells and C3H/NE trophectoderm cells. IRS-1 protein was detected in
     these cell lines and in an overexpressing CHO-IRS-1 fibroblast cell line
     by immunocytochemistry. Cultured blastocyst outgrowths are a model for
     implantation events of the trophoblast/placenta lineage and endoderm/yolk
     sac lineage. In the blastocyst outgrowth, IRS-1 protein is detected in
     inner cell mass cells (ICM cells), primitive endoderm, parietal endoderm,
     and trophectoderm cells. These data suggest that IRS-1 is expressed in all
     cell lineages of the peri-implantation mouse embryo and mediates some
     effects of insulin and IGFs at this stage.

PG  - 940-50
AB  - The mechanism whereby agonist occupancy of muscarinic cholinergic
     receptors elicits an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion
     kinase (FAK) and paxillin has been examined. Addition of oxotremorine-M to
     SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells resulted in rapid increases in the
     phosphorylation of FAK (t(1/2) = 2 min) and paxillin that were independent
     of integrin-extracellular matrix interactions, cell attachment, and the
     production of phosphoinositide-derived second messengers. In contrast, the
     increased tyrosine phosphorylations of FAK and paxillin were inhibited by
     inclusion of either cytochalasin D or mevastatin, agents that disrupt the
     cytoskeleton. Furthermore, phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin could be
     prevented by addition of either wortmannin or LY-294002, under conditions
     in which the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate was markedly
     attenuated. These results indicate that muscarinic receptor-mediated
     increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin in SH-SY5Y
     neuroblastoma cells depend on both the maintenance of an actin
     cytoskeleton and the ability of these cells to synthesize
     phosphoinositides.

TI  - Overexpression of insulin receptor substrate-1 emerges early in
     hepatocarcinogenesis and elicits preneoplastic hepatic glycogenosis.
PG  - 341-5
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a multisite docking protein
     occupying a central position in signaling cascades stimulated by a number
     of growth factors including insulin. Using Western blotting and
     immunohistochemistry, we investigated the expression of IRS-1 in more than
     400 preneoplastic foci of altered hepatocytes and in 12 hepatocellular
     carcinomas induced in rats by oral administration of N-nitrosomorpholine.
     In both N-nitrosomorpholine-treated and untreated rat livers, IRS-1 was
     demonstrable by Western blotting, but with the exception of a few single
     hepatocytes it was not detectable in the normal parenchyma by
     immunohistochemistry. In contrast, immunohistochemistry revealed that
     IRS-1 was strongly expressed in the majority of foci of altered
     hepatocytes particularly in approximately 97% of the clear/acidophilic and
     mixed cell foci showing excessive storage of glycogen (glycogenosis). In
     glycogen-poor basophilic foci of altered hepatocytes and hepatocellular
     carcinomas, IRS-1 was not detected by immunohistochemistry, but a weak
     expression was observed in small subpopulations of three hepatocellular
     carcinomas containing remnants of glycogen. These results indicate that
     the focal overexpression of IRS-1 is an early event in
     hepatocarcinogenesis, which is closely correlated with preneoplastic
     hepatic glycogenosis. During progression from glycogenotic foci to
     hepatocellular carcinomas, IRS-1-overexpression is gradually
     down-regulated, and this late event is associated with a fundamental
     metabolic shift leading to the malignant neoplastic phenotype.

TI  - Early signaling events triggered by peroxovanadium [bpV(phen)] are insulin
     receptor kinase (IRK)-dependent: specificity of inhibition of
     IRK-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase(s) by bpV(phen).
PG  - 1899-910
AB  - Peroxovanadiums (pVs) are potent protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)
     inhibitors with insulin-mimetic properties in vivo and in vitro. We have
     established the existence of an insulin receptor kinase (IRK)-associated
     PTP whose inhibition by pVs correlates closely with IRK tyrosine
     phosphorylation, activation, and downstream signaling. pVs have also been
     shown to activate various tyrosine kinases (TKs) that could participate in
     activation of the insulin-signaling pathway. In the present study we have
     sought to determine whether pV-induced IRK tyrosine phosphorylation
     requires the intrinsic kinase activity of the IRK, and whether IRK
     activation is necessary to realize the early steps in the
     insulin-signaling cascade. To address this we evaluated the effect of a
     pure pV compound, bis peroxovanadium 1,10-phenanthroline [bpV(phen)], in
     HTC rat hepatoma cells overexpressing normal (HTC-IR) or kinase-deficient
     (HTC-M1030) mutant IRKs. We showed that at a dose of 0.1 mM, but not 1 mM,
     bpV(phen) induced IRK-dependent events. Thus, 0.1 mM bpV(phen) increased
     tyrosine phosphorylation and IRK activity in HTC-IR but not HTC-M1030
     cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin signal-transducing molecules
     was promoted in HTC-IR but not HTC-M1030 cells by bpV(phen). The
     association of p185 and p60 with the src homology-2 (SH2) domains of Syp
     and the p85-regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase was
     induced by bpV(phen) in HTC-IR, but not in HTC-M1030 cells, as was insulin
     receptor substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity.
     Thus autophosphorylation and activation of the IRK by bpV(phen) is
     effected by the IRK itself, and the early events in the insulin- signaling
     cascade follow from this activation event. This establishes a critical
     role for PTP(s) in the regulation of IRK activity. bpV(phen) could be
     distinguished from insulin only in its ability to activate ERK1 in
     HTC-M1030 cells, thus indicating that this event is IRK independent,
     consistent with our previous hypothesis that bpV(phen) inhibits a PTP
     involved in the negative regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases.

TI  - The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor is required for EWS/FLI-1
     transformation of fibroblasts.
PG  - 30822-7
AB  - Ewing's family of tumors is characterized by a well described reciprocal
     translocation, t(11;22)(q24;q12), which produces a fusion protein
     (EWS/FLI-1) that transforms mouse fibroblasts. The EWS/FLI-1 fusion
     protein has been shown to act as a potent chimeric transcription factor.
     Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) has been
     implicated in many tumor models as playing a role in cell growth and
     tumorigenesis. In addition, blockade of the IGF-IR inhibits the growth of
     Ewing's family of tumors cells. Therefore, we first studied whether the
     presence of the IGF-IR is required for transformation by the EWS/FLI-1
     fusion protein. To perform this study, we used two previously described
     fibroblast cell lines, R- and W, derived from an IGF-IR knockout mouse and
     a wild-type littermate, respectively. Neither W nor R- cells without the
     fusion protein formed soft agar colonies. However, W clones expressing the
     fusion message (WF cells) formed soft agar colonies, whereas R- clones
     expressing the fusion message (R-F cells) did not form soft agar colonies.
     Because the IGF-IR is required for EWS/FLI-1 transformation, we chose to
     investigate whether altered signaling occurs from the IGF-IR when the
     EWS/FLI-1 fusion is present. WF cells demonstrated a greater degree of
     ligand-stimulated insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation when
     compared with W cells, suggesting that expression of the EWS/FLI-1 fusion
     protein alters the IGF-IR signaling pathway.

     implications for pathogenesis.
PG  - 774-800
AB  - It is now clear that PCOS is often associated with profound insulin
     resistance as well as with defects in insulin secretion. These
     abnormalities, together with obesity, explain the substantially increased
     prevalence of glucose intolerance in PCOS. Moreover, since PCOS is an
     extremely common disorder, PCOS-related insulin resistance is an important
     cause of NIDDM in women (Table 3). The insulin resistance in at least 50%
     of PCOS women appears to be related to excessive serine phosphorylation of
     the insulin receptor. A factor extrinsic to the insulin receptor,
     presumably a serine/threonine kinase, causes this abnormality and is an
     example of an important new mechanism for human insulin resistance related
     to factors controlling insulin receptor signaling. Serine phosphorylation
     appears to modulate the activity of the key regulatory enzyme of androgen
     biosynthesis, P450c17. It is thus possible that a single defect produces
     both the insulin resistance and the hyperandrogenism in some PCOS women
     (Fig. 19). Recent studies strongly suggest that insulin is acting through
     its own receptor (rather than the IGF-I receptor) in PCOS to augment not
     only ovarian and adrenal steroidogenesis but also pituitary LH release.
     Indeed, the defect in insulin action appears to be selective, affecting
     glucose metabolism but not cell growth. Since PCOS usually has a menarchal
     age of onset, this makes it a particularly appropriate disorder in which
     to examine the ontogeny of defects in carbohydrate metabolism and for
     ascertaining large three-generation kindreds for positional cloning
     studies to identify NIDDM genes. Although the presence of lipid
     abnormalities, dysfibrinolysis, and insulin resistance would be predicted
     to place PCOS women at high risk for cardiovascular disease, appropriate
     prospective studies are necessary to directly assess this.

     cancer.
PG  - 565-71
AB  - The insulin receptor (IR), a ligand-activated tyrosine kinase, is present
     in breast cancers, but its relationship to patient survival is unknown.
     The IR was measured in 584 tumor specimens from patients with
     node-negative breast carcinoma by frozen-section immunohistochemistry and
     light microscopy. The immunostaining signal was quantitated in relation to
     both the staining intensity and the proportion of positive malignant
     epithelial cells. Analyses indicated that patients with tumors with
     undetectable IR content in malignant epithelial cells (260 cases) had a
     relatively lower predicted 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) (69% +/- 3%)
     than did patients with tumors with detectable IR content (324 cases; DFS
     76% +/- 3%, p = .032). The significance of IR content in these breast
     malignant epithelial cells was then analyzed along with patient age, tumor
     size, progesterone and estrogen receptor status, p53 accumulation, and
     S-phase. Multivariate analysis of these data revealed that after
     adjustment for these other variables, IR content was the strongest
     independent predictive factor for DFS (relative risk = 1.73, p = .005).
     Interestingly, in a small subset of patients with very high IR content (n
     = 62), DFS was decreased. These data indicate that IR content in
     node-negative breast cancers is a significant major predictor of reduced
     DFS. Moreover, they raise the possibility that the measurement of IR
     content might provide important information concerning breast cancer
     biology.

     Src homology 2 and pleckstrin homology domain-containing insulin receptor
     binding protein hGrb10gamma.
PG  - 29104-12
AB  - hGrb10alpha (previously named Grb-IR) is a Src-homology 2
     domain-containing protein that binds with high affinity to the
     tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor-1
     receptor. At least two isoforms of human Grb10, (hGrb10alpha and
     hGrb10beta), which differ in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the
     N-terminal sequence, have previously been identified in insulin target
     tissues such as human skeletal muscle and fat cells. Here we report the
     cloning of the third isoform of the hGrb10 family (hGrb10gamma) from human
     skeletal muscle and its localization to human chromosome 7. We have also
     determined the human chromosome localization of Grb7 to 17q21-q22 and
     Grb14 to chromosome 2. hGrb10gamma contains an intact PH domain and an
     N-terminal sequence that is present in hGrb10alpha but absent in
     hGrb10beta. RNase protection assays and Western blot analysis showed that
     hGrb10alpha and hGrb10gamma are differentially expressed in insulin target
     cells including skeletal muscle, liver, and adipocyte cells. hGrb10gamma
     is also expressed in HeLa cells and various breast cancer cell lines. The
     protein bound with high affinity to the insulin receptor in cells, and the
     interaction was dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor.
     hGrb10gamma also underwent insulin-stimulated membrane translocation and
     serine phosphorylation. hGrb10gamma phosphorylation was inhibited by
     PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase,
     and wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
     Taken together, our data suggest that hGrb10 isoforms are potential
     downstream signaling components of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase
     and that the PH domain may play an important role in the involvement of
     these isoforms in signal transduction pathways initiated by insulin and
     other growth factors.

TI  - The IRS-pathway operates distinctively from the Stat-pathway in
     hematopoietic cells and transduces common and distinct signals during
     engagement of the insulin or interferon-alpha receptors.
PG  - 2574-82
AB  - Binding of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) to its receptor on hematopoietic
     cells activates the signal transducers and activators of transcription
     (Stat)- and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-pathways, and regulates
     expression of antiproliferative and antiviral activities. However, it
     remains unknown whether these two pathways cooperate in the generation of
     IFN-alpha responses or function independently, and whether IRS-proteins
     transduce distinct downstream signals in response to IFNs or
     insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1-mediated activation. Our data
     show that in response to IFN-alpha treatment, IRS-1 functions selectively
     as a docking protein for the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of the PI
     3'-kinase, but not the SH2 domain of Grb-2 which is engaged during
     insulin/IGF-1 signaling. In studies with THP-1 human myelomonocytic cells
     and 32D mouse myeloid cells, which are IRS-defective, we found that the
     IFN-alpha-regulated activation of Stat-1, Stat-2, and Stat-3 does not
     require the function of the IRS-system. Furthermore, THP-1 cells are
     responsive to the protective effect of IFN-alpha against vesicular
     stomatitis virus. Both 32D and THP-1 cells were resistant to the growth
     inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha, but this effect was not reversible by
     expression of IRS-1 or IRS-2 alone in 32D cells. Taken altogether these
     data show that: (1) The IRS-system transduces common and distinct signals
     in response to IFN-alpha or insulin/lGF-1 stimulation of hematopoietic
     cells. (2) The IRS-pathway operates separately from the Stat-pathway, and
     its function is not essential for the generation of the antiviral effect
     of IFN-alpha. (3) Neither the IRS- nor the Stat-pathways alone are
     sufficient to mediate the antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha in
     hematopoietic cells, and additional signaling elements are required.

TI  - Alphavbeta3 integrin associates with activated insulin and PDGFbeta
     receptors and potentiates the biological activity of PDGF.
PG  - 5600-7
AB  - Integrin-mediated cell attachment modulates growth responses and growth
     factors regulate cell attachment. Moreover, both cell attachment to
     extracellular matrix and mitogenic signaling by growth factors are
     necessary for the proliferation of most types of normal cells, suggesting
     that integrin and growth factor receptor signaling pathways meet at some
     downstream point. We report here that a small, highly
     tyrosine-phosphorylated fraction of PDGFbeta and insulin receptors
     co-immunoprecipitates with the alphavbeta3 integrin from cells. The
     integrin association requires growth factor stimulation of the receptors.
     Several signaling molecules that are known to be associated with activated
     growth factor receptors were present in the alphavbeta3 integrin
     complexes. Mitogenicity and chemotaxis induced by PDGF-BB were enhanced in
     cells plated on the alphavbeta3 ligand vitronectin compared with cells
     plated on the beta1 integrin ligand collagen. Thus, the engagement of the
     alphavbeta3 integrin in cell-matrix interactions appears to coordinate an
     intense response to growth factors, helping to explain the importance of
     this integrin for tissue regeneration, angiogenesis and tumor metastasis.

     hepatocytes.
PG  - 598-604
AB  - The human insulin receptor substrate-1 (hIRS-1) is a key intracellular
     protein involved in various cytokine signaling pathways associated with
     cell growth. We have previously demonstrated that stable transfection and
     overexpression of hIRS-1 in human hepatoblastoma cells in vitro leads to
     the constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
     cascade. In this setting, hIRS-1 acts as a dominant oncogene and will
     induce neoplastic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. In the present study,
     the biologic effects of hIRS-1 overexpression in the liver was analyzed
     using both clinical tumor samples and a newly developed transgenic mouse
     model. We have found that approximately 40% of 22 human hepatocellular
     carcinoma (HCC) tumors had enhanced (>200%) hIRS-1 gene expression
     compared with adjacent non-involved liver tissue. There was a significant
     relationship between the level of hIRS-1 overexpression and the tumor
     size; this finding suggests a possible role for hIRS-1 in tumor
     progression. To determine if downstream signal transduction cascades were
     activated by overexpression of hIRS-1 in hepatocytes, we established a
     transgenic mouse model using an hIRS-1 construct driven by an albumin
     promoter/enhancer element to direct liver specific expression. The
     overexpressed hIRS-1 protein was found to be tyrosyl phosphorylated and
     interacted with downstream SH2-containing molecules such as the p85
     subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), Grb2 adaptor, and SHP2
     phosphatase proteins. The functional consequences of hIRS-1 overexpression
     were reflected by constitutive activation of both the MAPK and PI3K signal
     transduction cascades. More important, overexpression of hIRS-1 in the
     transgenic liver led to increased hepatocyte DNA synthesis. Our findings
     indicate that hIRS-1 overexpression induces downstream signaling molecules
     associated with hepatocyte growth and may potentially enhance tumor
     progression of HCC.

     cells.
PG  - 828-34
AB  - Several polypeptide growth factors stimulate breast cancer growth and may
     be involved in tumor progression. However, the relative importance of
     diverse growth factor signaling pathways in the development and
     maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype is largely unknown. The activation
     of such growth factor receptors as the insulin-like growth factor I
     receptor (IGF-I R), erbB-type receptors (erbB Rs) and FGF receptors (FGF
     Rs) controls the phenotype of a model breast cancer cell line MCF-7. To
     evaluate the function of 2 post-receptor signaling molecules, insulin
     receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) (a major substrate of the IGF-IR) and SHC (a
     common substrate of tyrosine kinase receptors), we developed several
     MCF-7-derived cell clones in which the synthesis of either IRS-1 or SHC
     was blocked by antisense RNA. In MCF-7 cells, down-regulation of IRS-1 by
     80-85% strongly suppressed anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and
     induced apoptotic cell death under growth factor- and estrogen-reduced
     conditions. The reduction of SHC levels by approximately 50% resulted in
     the inhibition of monolayer and anchorage-independent growth but did not
     decrease cell survival. Importantly, cell aggregation and the ability of
     cells to survive on the extracellular matrix were inhibited in
     MCF-7/anti-SHC clones, but not in MCF-7/anti-IRS-1 clones. Cell motility
     toward IGF was not attenuated in any of the tested cell lines, but
     motility toward EGF was decreased in MCF-7/anti-SHC clones. Our results
     suggest that in MCF-7 cells: 1) both IRS-1 and SHC are implicated in the
     control of monolayer and anchorage-independent growth; 2) IRS-1 is
     critical to support cell survival; 3) SHC is involved in EGF-dependent
     motility; and 4) normal levels of SHC, but not IRS-1, are necessary for
     the formation and maintenance of cell-cell interactions.

AB  - Glycine-extended gastrin precursors (G-Gly) were considered as processing
     intermediates devoid of biological activity. However, we have recently
     identified selective receptors for G-Gly which mediate the proliferative
     effects of this precursor. Little is known about the signaling pathways
     activated by G-Gly. In the present study, we demonstrate that PI-3-kinase
     is rapidly and transiently activated by G-Gly. We also observed a rapid
     increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and an activation of the
     PI-3-kinase in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that PI-3-kinase
     may be activated by association with tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-1. We
     also demonstrated that gastrin precursors activate the serine/threonine
     kinase, p70 kDa S6 kinase (p70S6K), through a wortmannin sensitive
     pathway.

TI  - Mitogenic properties of insulin and insulin analogues mediated by the
     insulin receptor.
PG  - S25-31
AB  - Insulin has traditionally been considered as a hormone essential for
     metabolic regulation, while the insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and
     IGF-II) are postulated to be more specifically involved in growth
     regulation. The conventional wisdom is that they share each other's
     effects only at high concentrations, due to their weak affinity for the
     heterologous receptor. We discuss here the evidence that in the proper
     cellular context, insulin can be mitogenic at physiologic concentrations
     through its own receptor. We studied the insulin and IGF-I binding
     characteristics of a new model suitable for analysing insulin receptor
     mediated mitogenesis; that is, a T-cell lymphoma line that depends on
     insulin for growth, but is unresponsive to IGFs. The cells showed no
     specific binding of 125I-IGF-I and furthermore, no IGF-I receptor mRNA was
     detected by RNAse protection assay in the LB cells, in contrast with mouse
     brain and thymus. The cells bound at saturation about 3000 insulin
     molecules to receptors that had normal characteristics in terms of
     affinity, kinetics, pH dependence and negative co-operativity. A series of
     insulin analogues competed for 125I-insulin binding with relative
     potencies comparable to those observed in other insulin target cells. The
     full sequence of the insulin receptor cDNA was determined and found to be
     identical to the published sequence of the murine insulin receptor cDNA.
     The LB cell line is therefore an ideal model with which to investigate
     insulin mitogenic signalling without interference from the IGF-I receptor.
     Using this model, we have started approaching the molecular basis of
     insulin-induced mitogenesis, in particular the role of signalling kinetics
     in choosing between mitogenic and metabolic pathways.

PG  - 2979-88
AB  - We investigated cellular proliferation, the transforming activity, and
     activation of known signal transduction pathways in NIH-3T3 cells stably
     expressing insulin-like growth factor-I receptors (IGF-IRs) with amino
     acid substitutions in the carboxy(C)-terminal domain. The mutant receptors
     contained substitutions of both tyrosines 1250 and 1251 with phenylalanine
     and histidine (amino acids present in the analogous positions in the
     insulin receptor), as well as phenylalanine 1310 replaced by tyrosine (IsY
     clones) to resemble the placement of tyrosine residues in the C-terminal
     domain of the insulin receptor. As a control for the IsY clones, a second
     mutant receptor was expressed with a substitution of phenylalanine 1310
     with tyrosine only (DBY clones). Clones expressing IGF-IRs with the IsY
     substitutions had a significantly slower rate of growth compared with
     cells expressing an equivalent number of wild-type IGF-IRs (NWT). In
     contrast, the DBY clones showed relatively normal growth rates. Cells with
     wild-type IGF-IR demonstrated a transformed phenotype in soft agar assays.
     The IsY clones lost the transforming ability of the wild type IGF-IR,
     whereas DBY clones formed colonies. IGF-I-stimulated autophosphorylation
     of the IGF-IR and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and SHC, known
     substrates in the IGF-IR signal transduction pathway, were studied.
     Mutated IGF-IRs (IsY and DBY) did not alter the IGF-I-induced tyrosine
     phosphorylation of these proteins. Furthermore, the mutated IGF-IRs did
     not alter Grb2 association with phosphorylated IRS-1 and SHC. IGF-I
     stimulation of Crk-II phosphorylation, a novel substrate of the IGF-IR,
     was similar in cells expressing mutated and wild-type IGF-IRs.
     IGF-I-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3'-kinase was
     equivalent in cells expressing either mutant or wild-type IGF-IRs. These
     data suggest that the IGF-IR mediates, at least in part, cellular
     proliferation and increased transforming ability through its C-terminal
     domain. The exact postreceptor signaling pathway(s) involved have yet to
     be fully elucidated.

     oncogenes.
PG  - 3744-54
AB  - R- cells, a line of mouse embryo fibroblasts with a targeted disruption of
     the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor genes, are refractory to
     transformation by several viral and cellular oncogenes. Using colony
     formation in soft agar as a measure of full transformation, we report here
     that R- cells can be transformed by v-src, although they still cannot be
     transformed by the activated c-src527 (mutation at tyrosine 527 to
     phenylalanine), which readily transforms mouse embryo cells with a
     wild-type number of IGF-I receptors (W cells). Although v-src is a more
     potent inducer of tyrosine phosphorylation than c-src527, the extent of
     phosphorylation of either insulin receptor substrate 1 or Shc, two of the
     major substrates of the IGF-I receptor, does not seem sufficiently
     different to explain the qualitative difference in soft agar growth.
     v-src, however, is considerably more efficient than c-src527 in its
     ability to tyrosyl phosphorylate, in R- cells, the focal adhesion kinase,
     Stat1, and p130cas. These results indicate that v-src, but not c-src527,
     can bypass the requirement for a functional IGF-I receptor in the full
     transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts and suggest that qualitative
     and quantitative differences between the two oncogenes can be used to
     identify some of the signals relevant to the mechanism(s) of
     transformation.

TI  - The protein tyrosine phosphatase LAR has a major impact on insulin
     receptor dephosphorylation.
PG  - 709-12
AB  - Transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) may act as
     regulators of the insulin receptor. Supporting this hypothesis, antisense
     suppression of the PTPase LAR in McA-RH7777 hepatoma cells increased
     insulin receptor signaling (Kulas et. al., J. Biol. Chem. (1996) 271,
     748-754). The effects of decreased LAR expression may be mediated by
     decreased dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor. The rate of insulin
     receptor dephosphorylation was examined in situ, following elution of
     surface bound insulin at pH 4.0. In LAR antisense cells, dephosphorylation
     was prolonged by 2.6-fold with a t(1/2) of 87+/-11 sec compared to a
     t(1/2) of 34+/-6 sec in control cells. EGF receptor dephosphorylation was
     also prolonged in LAR antisense cells. These results are further evidence
     that LAR is a physiological regulator of the insulin receptor and is
     consistent with its direct interaction with the tyrosine phosphorylated
     insulin receptor.

PG  - 317-20
AB  - STAT proteins are important transcription factors that regulate cell
     growth and differentiation. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of
     insulin actions, we have studied how insulin activates STAT proteins in
     Hep3B cells. Insulin rapidly phosphorylated Stat1alpha at tyrosine
     residues and increased its specific binding activities to a GAS/ISRE
     consensus oligonucleotide. IL-4 also phosphorylated Stat1alpha and
     increased DNA binding activities to the same Stat1alpha responsive
     element. There was no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK family
     of kinases following insulin stimulation. In contrast, IL-4 stimulated
     tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and tyk2 in this cell line. These
     data indicate that insulin receptor signaling can activate the
     transcriptional regulatory function of STAT protein, and that insulin
     actions on Stat1alpha are mediated through signaling pathways independent
     of JAK family of kinases.

PG  - 2566-76
AB  - Glycosyltransferase gene transfection into cell lines has been an approach
     used successfully to elucidate the functional role of cell surface
     glycoconjugates. We have transfected the rat CMP-NeuAc:Galbeta1,4GlcNAc
     alpha2,6-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.1) gene into a human, tumorigenic,
     glioma cell line, U373 MG. This transfection led to a marked inhibition of
     invasivity, alterations in adhesivity to fibronectin and collagen
     matrices, and inappropriately sialylated alpha3beta1 integrin.
     Adhesion-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced in the
     transfectants despite increased expression of focal adhesion kinase,
     p125fak. Furthermore, the transfectants showed a distinct cell morphology,
     an increased number of focal adhesion sites, and different sensitivity to
     cytochalasin D treatment than control U373 MG cells. These results suggest
     that inappropriate sialylation of cell surface glycoconjugates, such as
     integrins, can change focal adhesion as well as adhesion-mediated signal
     transduction and block glioma cell invasivity in vitro.

PG  - 955-60
AB  - A new class of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors was identified that is
     based on an oxindole core (indolinones). Two compounds from this class
     inhibited the kinase activity of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1
     (FGFR1) and showed differential specificity toward other receptor tyrosine
     kinases. Crystal structures of the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1 in
     complex with the two compounds were determined. The oxindole occupies the
     site in which the adenine of adenosine triphosphate binds, whereas the
     moieties that extend from the oxindole contact residues in the hinge
     region between the two kinase lobes. The more specific inhibitor of FGFR1
     induces a conformational change in the nucleotide-binding loop. This
     structural information will facilitate the design of new inhibitors for
     use in the treatment of cancer and other diseases in which cell signaling
     by tyrosine kinases plays a crucial role in disease pathogenesis.

     during differentiation of HT29-D4 human colonic carcinoma cells.
PG  - 2021-32
AB  - To assess the autocrine function of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II)
     in the balance of proliferation and differentiation in HT29-D4 human
     colonic cancer cells, we studied the expression of IGF-I receptors
     (IGF-IR) and insulin receptors (IR) in relation to the state of cell
     differentiation. IGF-IR and IR were expressed in both undifferentiated and
     enterocyte-like differentiated HT29-D4 cells. IGF-IR had two isoforms with
     a 97-kDa and a 102-kDa beta-subunit. In addition, HT29-D4 cells expressed
     hybrid receptors (HR) formed by the association of two alphabeta
     heterodimers from both IR and IGF-IR. HR were evidenced through 1)
     inhibition of IGF-I binding by the B6 anti-IR antibody and 2)
     immunoprecipitation with the alpha-IR3 anti-IGF-IR antibody, which
     revealed an additional 95-kDa IR beta-subunit that disappeared when the
     heterotetrameric receptor was dissociated by disulfide reduction into
     alphabeta heterodimers before immunoprecipitation. Like IGF-IR, HR had a
     high affinity for IGF-I (Kd, approximately 1.5 nM), but did not bind
     insulin significantly; the latter interacted with the native IR only (Kd,
     approximately 4 nM). In the differentiated HT29-D4 cell monolayer, all
     receptor species were strongly polarized (>97%) toward the basolateral
     membrane. Moreover, HT29-D4 cell differentiation was accompanied by an
     approximately 2-fold increase in the number of IR, whereas the number of
     IGF-I-binding sites was unaltered. However, in differentiated HT29-D4
     cells, approximately 55% of the latter were involved in HR vs.
     approximately 20% in undifferentiated HT29-D4 cells. Thus, HT29-D4 cell
     differentiation is characterized by an up-regulation (approximately
     3-fold) of the level of HR coupled to a down-regulation (approximately
     40%) of the level of native tetrameric IGF-IR. Alterations were induced
     early during the cell differentiation process, i.e. 5 days postconfluence,
     and remained unchanged for at least 21 days. Taken together, these results
     suggest that the IGF-II autocrine loop in HT29-D4 cells may trigger
     distinct signaling pathways if it activates native IGF-IR, which
     predominate in undifferentiated cells, or if it activates HR, which are
     up-regulated in differentiated cells.

TI  - Overexpressed IGF-I receptors reduce estrogen growth requirements, enhance

     breast cancer cells.
PG  - 149-62
AB  - The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) paracrine or autocrine
     loop plays an important role in the maintenance of breast cancer growth.
     Cancer cells contain several-fold higher levels of the IGF-IR than normal
     breast tissue; however, it is still not clear whether abnormally high
     activation of IGF-IR signaling may induce progression of the disease. To
     address this question, we have established several MCF-7-derived clones
     (MCF-7/IGF-IR cells) overexpressing the IGF-IR. We report here that
     overexpression of the IGF-IR did not modify sensitivity of cells to IGF-I;
     however, responsiveness to the ligand was moderately enhanced in most of
     the MCF-7/IGF-IR clones (measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into
     DNA). All MCF-7/IGF-IR clones responded to the synergistic action of 1 nM
     estradiol (E2) and small amounts of IGF-I (up to 0.8 ng/ml). Exposure of
     cells to higher concentrations of IGF-I abolished estrogen requirements
     for stimulation of DNA synthesis in all MCF-7/IGF-IR clones, but not in
     the parental cells. The most important finding of this work was that the
     amplification of the IGF-IR induced cell-cell adhesion in MCF-7 cells.
     High levels of the IGF-IR promoted cell aggregation on Matrigel, allowed
     proliferation of cells within the aggregates, and protected clustered
     cells from death. In both MCF-7 and MCF-7/IGF-IR cells, IGF-I stimulated
     aggregation, whereas an anti-E cadherin antibody blocked cell-cell
     adhesion. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining with specific
     antibodies revealed co-localization of the IGF-IR and E-cadherin at the
     points of cell-cell contacts. Moreover, the IGF-IR and its two substrates,
     insulin receptor substrate 1 and SHC, were contained within the E-cadherin
     complexes. Our results suggest that overexpressed IGF-IRs, by promoting
     the aggregation, growth, and survival of breast cancer cells, may
     accelerate the increase of tumor mass and may also prevent cell
     scattering.

TI  - The IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor
     substrate is dependent on JAK1 expression in human fibrosarcoma cells.
PG  - 1037-40
AB  - It has been shown that IL-4 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1
     and JAK3 in the majority of hemopoietic cell types, and JAK2 and TYK2 in
     several other types. However, the significance of this tyrosine
     phosphorylation in regulating IL-4 signaling has not been shown. To
     determine whether JAKs play a role in activating a signal transduction
     pathway different from the classical JAK/STAT pathway, we analyzed the
     ability of huIL-4 to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of one of its
     major cellular substrates, the insulin receptor substrate (IRS). Using
     human fibrosarcoma cell lines with mutations in JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, we
     found that expression of functional JAK1, but not TYK2 or JAK2, is
     essential for IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS. We also
     provide evidence that the IRS pathway is independent of STAT-6, showing
     that JAK1 is essential for activating a STAT-independent pathway.

TI  - Human ovarian-carcinoma cell lines express IL-4 and IL-13 receptors:
     comparison between IL-4- and IL-13-induced signal transduction.
PG  - 230-40
AB  - We have reported that human ovarian-carcinoma cell lines express
     high-affinity IL-4 receptor. Since IL-4R has been hypothesized to share a
     chain with IL-13R, we investigated whether ovarian cancer cells express
     IL-13 receptor. In the present study, we report that the ovarian-carcinoma
     cell lines IGROV-1 and PA-1 express varying numbers of high-affinity IL-13
     receptors. Furthermore, IL-13 inhibited the binding of IL-4 on both
     ovarian-carcinoma cell lines, while IL-4 did not inhibit IL-13 binding on
     IGROV-1 cell line. IL-13 and IL-4 induced the phosphorylation of JAK1,
     JAK2 and Tyk2 Janus kinases in PA-1 cells. In contrast, JAK3 tyrosine
     kinase was expressed in PA-1 cells, but IL-4 or IL-13 did not augment its
     phosphorylation. In IGROV-1 cells, Tyk2 was constitutively phosphorylated
     and this phosphorylation was augmented by IL-4 or IL-13. JAK1 and JAK2 but
     not JAK3 were expressed but only JAK2 was faintly phosphorylated in
     response to either IL-13 or IL-4 respectively. IRS (insulin-receptor
     substrate)-1 and IRS-2 were also phosphorylated constitutively in both
     ovarian cancer cell lines examined, but only the phosphorylation of IRS-1
     was augmented in response to IL-4 or IL-13. STAT6 was phosphorylated and
     activated in response to IL-4 and IL-13 in all cell lines examined. Our
     results demonstrate that ovarian cancer cell lines may express 2 types of
     IL-13R and the IL-13- or IL-4-induced signaling patterns may be slightly
     different in each type of receptor.

     B cells.
PG  - 33-40
AB  - Interleukin 4 (IL-4) and Interleukin 13 (IL-13) have been shown to have
     numerous similar effects on human B cells; however, the mechanism of
     signal transduction is not known. We have examined IL-4- and IL-13-induced
     signal transduction in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized B cells. We
     demonstrate that Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and Tyk2 but not JAK1 and JAK2
     tyrosine kinases were constitutively phosphorylated in three EBV B cell
     lines. The phosphorylation level of Tyk2 was augmented at a low level in
     response to IL-13 and IL-4 in two of three cell lines; however, IL-13 did
     not induce or augment phosphorylation of the other JAK kinases. On the
     other hand, IL-4 further augmented phosphorylation of JAK3 and induced the
     phosphorylation of JAK1 kinases. IL-4 receptor p140 protein was also
     constitutively phosphorylated in two of three EBV B cell lines examined
     and both IL-4 and IL-13 further augmented its phosphorylation. Insulin
     receptor substrate (IRS)-1 or IRS-2 proteins were not constitutively
     phosphorylated nor did IL-13 and IL-4 induce phosphorylation of these
     proteins. In contrast to JAKs, IL-4-specific signal transducer and
     activator of transcription (STAT6) was not constitutively phosphorylated
     or activated in these cell lines, but both IL-4 and IL-13 induced their
     phosphorylation and activation. These findings suggest that in
     EBV-immortalized B cells JAK3 and Tyk2 proteins were constitutively
     phosphorylated but STAT6 protein was not constitutively phosphorylated. In
     addition, despite major similarities in biological effects between IL-4
     and IL-13, phosphorylation patterns of JAK kinases in response to IL-13 in
     EBV-immortalized B cells appear to be different from those of IL-4.

     oncogenic Ros, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor I receptors.
PG  - 146-53
AB  - The avian sarcoma virus UR2 codes for an oncogenic Gag-Ros fusion
     protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK). We have previously derived two
     retroviruses, T6 and NM1, coding for oncogenic Gag-insulin receptor and
     Gag-insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFR) fusion proteins,
     respectively. The Gag-IGFR fusion protein dimerizes, whereas Gag-Ros does
     not. To identify sequences affecting dimerization and the effect of
     dimerization on signaling and biological functions, we generated
     recombinants exchanging the extracellular and transmembrane sequences
     among the three fusion receptors. The presence of multiple cysteines in
     the Gag sequence appears to preclude dimerization, since deletion of the
     3' cysteine residue allows for dimerization. Most of the chimeric
     receptors retain high PTK activity and induce transformation regardless of
     their configuration on the cell surface. UT, a UR2/T6 chimera, retained
     mitogenic activity but has a markedly reduced transforming ability, while
     UN7, a UR2/NM1 recombinant, which also harbors Y950F and F951S mutations
     in IGFR, exhibits dramatic reductions in both activities. All of the
     fusion receptors can phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate 1 and
     activate PI 3-kinase. UT protein induces Shc phosphorylation, whereas UN7
     protein does not, but both are unable to activate mitogen-activated
     protein kinase. Our results show that overexpressed oncogenic Gag-fusion
     receptors do not require dimerization for their signaling and transforming
     functions and that the extracellular and transmembrane sequences of a
     receptor PTK can affect its specific substrate interactions.

TI  - Effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on the phosphorylation of tyrosine
     kinase receptors is associated with dynamic alterations in specific
     protein-tyrosine phosphatases.
PG  - 117-27
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can modulate the signalling
     capacity of tyrosine kinase receptors; in particular, TNF-alpha has been
     shown to mediate the insulin resistance associated with animal models of
     obesity and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In order to determine
     whether the effects of TNF-alpha might involve alterations in the
     expression of specific protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) that have
     been implicated in the regulation of growth factor receptor signalling,
     KRC-7 rat hepatoma cells were treated with TNF-alpha, and changes in
     overall tissue PTPase activity and the abundance of three major hepatic
     PTPases (LAR, PTP1B, and SH-PTP2) were measured in addition to effects of
     TNF-alpha on ligand-stimulated autophosphorylation of insulin and
     epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and insulin-stimulated insulin
     receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation. TNF-alpha caused a
     dose-dependent decrease in insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation and
     EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation to 47-50% of control. Overall
     PTPase activity in the cytosol fraction did not change with TNF-alpha
     treatment, and PTPase activity in the particulate fraction was decreased
     by 55-66%, demonstrating that increases in total cellular PTPase activity
     did not account for the observed alterations in receptor signalling.
     However, immunoblot analysis showed that TNF-alpha treatment resulted in a
     2.5-fold increase in the abundance of SH-PTP2, a 49% decrease in the
     transmembrane PTPase LAR, and no evident change in the expression of
     PTP1B. These data suggest that at least part of the TNF-alpha effect on
     pathways of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation may be exerted through the
     dynamic modulation of the expression of specific PTPases. Since SH-PTP2
     has been shown to interact directly with both the EGF receptor and IRS-1,
     increased abundance of this PTPase, may mediate the TNF-alpha effect to
     inhibit signalling through these proteins. Furthermore, decreased
     abundance of the LAR PTPase, which has been implicated in the regulation
     of insulin receptor phosphorylation, may account for the less marked
     effect of TNF-alpha on the autophosphorylation state of the insulin
     receptor while postreceptor actions of insulin are inhibited.

     human breast cancer cells.
PG  - 39-47
AB  - Estrogen and IGF-I are potent mitogens for most breast cancer cell lines,
     and although their signaling pathways contrast, there is considerable
     interaction between them. Recent evidence indicating that IGF-I can alter
     estrogen receptor (ER) action led us to investigate whether an inhibitor
     of IGF-I action. IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), could affect
     transcriptional activation of ER. First, we confirmed that tamoxifen (TAM)
     could inhibit IGF-I-mediated proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Although TAM
     can increase IGFBP-3 expression in MCF-7 cells, and this binding protein
     has been shown to be able to inhibit IGF action, TAM had no effect on
     IGF-I-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-I receptor or the
     downstream signaling molecule, insulin receptor substrate-1. Therefore, to
     confirm that IGF-I was affecting transcriptional activation of ER, we
     utilized a gene reporter assay using a single consensus estrogen response
     element (ERE-tk-luc) upstream of luciferase. As expected, estradiol (E2;
     1nM) increased transcriptional activation three- to fivefold from the ERE
     in three ER-positive breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, ZR-75 and T47D). A
     2.5-to 4-fold increase was also seen with IGF-I (5 nM). TAM (1 microM)
     effectively blocked activation by E2 and IGF-I, indicating disruption of
     ER-mediated transcription. As expected, human recombinant IGFBP-1 (80 nM)
     completely inhibited IGF-I-mediated activation of ER, however, IGFBP-1
     also caused a significant decrease in E2-mediated activation. We also
     noticed that IGF-I increased the activity of all plasmids that we
     cotransfected including TATA-luc, SV40-luc and pGL Basic. This effect was
     post-transcriptional, as it was not affected by actinomycin D (2
     micrograms/ml), while we were able to completely inhibit E2-mediated
     transcriptional activation of ERE-tk-luc. Unlike the complete inhibition
     of ER-mediated transcriptional activation by actinomycin D, IGF-I-mediated
     transactivation was reduced by only 50%, indicating that the activation by
     IGF-I represented both transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects.
     This study confirmed that IGF-I can cause transcriptional activation of
     endogenous ER in human breast cancel cells, and inhibition of ER action by
     IGFBP-1 suggests that IGF-1 signaling may be necessary for maximal ER
     activation.

PG  - 32276-80
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is involved in insulin signal
     transduction distal to receptor occupation. Targeted disruption of IRS-1
     leads to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in mice, which suggests that
     altered IRS-1 expression could contribute to the insulin resistance seen
     in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In vitro studies using phorbol
     esters have implicated the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway as being
     involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Using the MCF-7 breast
     cancer cell, a role for PKC in regulating IRS-1 expression was examined.
     In an MCF-7 cell line (MCF-7-PKC-alpha) that exhibits multiple alterations
     in PKC isoform expression, IRS-1 content was reduced to negligible levels
     relative to parental MCF-7 cells. This decrease in IRS-1 content was
     associated with a 30-fold reduction in IRS-1 transcription. In parental
     MCF-7 cells, PKC inhibitors (GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I) and
     staurosporine) reduced IRS-1 content. Chronic exposure to
     12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; >8 h) reduced IRS-1 content and
     down-regulated the novel PKC-delta isoform. Bryostatin 1 inhibited
     TPA-induced depletion of both IRS-1 and PKC-delta expression in MCF-7
     cells. Associated with TPA-induced reduction in IRS-1 content was a
     reduction in IRS-1 transcription. These data demonstrate that PKC can
     modulate IRS-1 content and suggest a potential role for PKC-delta in
     positively regulating IRS-1 expression.

PG  - 1593-7
AB  - Colon carcinoma is the most common tumor of the gastrointestinal tract.
     According to some investigators, insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF)
     and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) man be involved in the neoplastic
     proliferation. Insulin-binding and receptor tyrosine kinase activity were
     investigated in colon carcinomas and in normal colons. The insulin
     receptor concentration, as shown by binding assays, was 17.4 +/- 4.3
     fmol/micrograms in normal colon and 29.69 +/- 9.4 fmol/micrograms in colon
     carcinoma. Nevertheless, the insulin affinity of the receptor was similar
     in both groups (Kd identical to 1 nM). Both normal and neoplastic colon
     showed phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. The electrophoretic
     migration of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptors purified from colon
     carcinomas was similar to that of normal colon and both tissues
     demonstrated an insulin-dependent autophosphorylation. The receptor
     tyrosine kinase activity was measured by the incorporation of [gamma
     32P]ATP into the beta-subunit. The basal and the insulin-stimulated
     tyrosine kinase activities were significantly higher in colon carcinomas
     compared to normal colon tissues (2.2 and 1.6 times, respectively).
     Understanding the metabolism of neoplastic cells may contribute to the
     development of prevention strategies as well as new therapies. It is now
     necessary to study other steps of the insulin signal transduction pathway,
     such as insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation.

     protein-tyrosine phosphatase LAR in hepatoma cells.
PG  - 467-73
AB  - Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) play an essential role in the
     regulation of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins
     that mediate insulin action. In order to explore the potential role of the
     transmembrane PTPase (LAR) in insulin receptor signal transduction, we
     overexpressed the full-length LAR protein in McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells
     and found that modest increases in the abundance of LAR protein expression
     downregulated a number of insulin-stimulated cellular responses closely
     related to the activation of the receptor kinase. An increase in LAR
     protein of 2.4-fold over the level in control cells caused a 40% reduction
     in insulin receptor autophosphorylation in intact cells, without an
     alteration in insulin receptor mass or a change in the insulin-stimulated
     receptor kinase activity measured with partially purified receptors in
     vitro. In addition, insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the
     endogenous insulin receptor substrates IRS-1 and Shc were decreased to 57%
     and 73% of control, respectively, and IRS-1 associated
     phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity was reduced to 47% of control of
     the cells overexpressing LAR. The present results, taken with our recent
     data demonstrating that reducing the abundance of LAR by expression of
     antisense mRNA enhances insulin receptor signal transduction (Kulas D. T.,
     et al. J. Biol. Chem. 270:2435, 1995), supports the hypothesis that LAR
     acts as a physiological modulator of insulin action in insulin-sensitive
     hepatoma cells.

     negative protein reverses the human hepatocellular carcinoma malignant
     phenotype.
PG  - 2100-8
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), a substrate of various receptor
     tyrosine kinases transmits mitogenic signals initiated by extracellular
     ligands. This protein is involved in normal hepatocyte growth and has been
     found to be overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Expression of
     a carboxy-terminal truncated IRS-1 molecule containing the pleckstrin
     homology and phosphotyrosine-binding domains associates with the insulin
     receptor and prevents tyrosyl phosphorylation of endogenous IRS-1 and Shc
     proteins. Thus, subsequent activation of downstream signaling molecules
     induced by insulin and IGF-1 such as phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and
     mitogen activated protein kinase is inhibited. The morphologic features of
     transformed human hepatocellular carcinoma cells change to a
     differentiated hepatocyte appearance and characteristics of the malignant
     phenotype as manifested by anchorage independent cell growth and tumor
     formation in nude mice are lost. These studies demonstrate that signal
     transduction pathways mediated through or by IRS-1 are important in
     hepatocyte and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth.

TI  - A 100-kDa protein tyrosine phosphorylation is concurrent with beta 1
     integrin-mediated morphological differentiation in neuroblastoma and small
     cell lung cancer cells.
PG  - 230-9
AB  - IMR32, a neuroblastoma cell line, and CADO LC6, a small cell lung cancer
     (SCLC) cell line, extended neurite-like processes when cultured on
     fibronectin (FN)-coated surfaces or cultured in a serum-free medium.
     Monoclonal antibodies against the integrin beta 1 subunit inhibited this
     process formation, suggesting that their morphological change is initiated
     by beta 1 integrin-dependent signal transduction to the cell interior.
     Anti-phosphorylation level of a 100-kDa protein, but not 125-kDa focal
     adhesion kindase, correlated well with the morphological change in both
     cell lines. This 100-kDa protein phosphorylation did not accompany
     FN-induced morphological changes in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts or A549
     adenocarcinoma cells. These findings suggest that neuroblastoma and SCLC
     may share beta 1 integrin-mediated signaling events distinct from
     nonneuronal cells.

TI  - Insulin and secretagogues differentially regulate fluid-phase pinocytosis
     in insulin-secreting beta-cells.
PG  - 623-9
AB  - The physiological role of the beta-cell insulin receptor is unknown. To
     evaluate a candidate function, the insulin regulation of fluid-phase
     pinocytosis was investigated in a clonal insulinoma cell line (beta
     TC6-F7) and, for comparison, also in Chinese hamster ovary cells
     transfected with the human insulin receptor (CHO-T cells). In CHO-T cells,
     the net rate of fluid-phase pinocytosis was rapidly increased 3-4-fold
     over the basal rate by 100 nM insulin, with half-maximal stimulation at 2
     nM insulin, as assayed by cellular uptake of horseradish peroxidase from
     the medium. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol
     (PI)-3-kinase, blocked insulin-stimulated pinocytosis with an IC50 of 7.5
     nM without affecting the basal rate of pinocytosis. In insulin-secreting
     beta TC6-F7 cells, the secretagogues glucose and carbachol (at maximally
     effective concentrations of 15 mM and 0.5 mM respectively) augmented
     fluid-phase pinocytosis 1.65-fold over the basal rate. Wortmannin also
     inhibited secretagogue-stimulated pinocytosis in these beta-cells with an
     IC50 of 7 nM but did not affect the basal rate of pinocytosis measured in
     the absence of secretagogues. Wortmannin did not influence either basal or
     secretagogue-induced insulin secretion. Although these beta TC6-F7 cells
     have cell-surface insulin receptors, adding exogenous insulin or
     insulin-like growth factor 1 did not affect their rate of fluid-phase
     pinocytosis, either in the absence or presence of secretagogues. From
     these observations, we conclude that: (1) in both insulin-secreting
     beta-cells and in conventional, insulin-responsive CHO-T cells, a common,
     wortmannin-sensitive reaction, which probably involves PI-3-kinase,
     regulates fluid-phase pinocytosis; (2) the insulin-receptor signal
     transduction pathway is dissociated from the regulation of fluid-phase
     pinocytosis in the insulin-secreting beta-cell line we studied; and (3)
     the enhancement of fluid-phase pinocytosis associated with
     secretagogue-induced insulin release in beta TC6-F7 cells is not
     attributable to autocrine activation of beta-cell surface insulin
     receptors.

     carcinoma cells prevents transforming growth factor beta1-induced
     apoptosis.
PG  - 3391-4
AB  - Insulin-like growth factors initiate tyrosyl phosphorylation of the
     insulin receptor substrate I (IRS-I) protein and activate multiple
     signaling pathways essential for liver growth. This gene has been found to
     be up-regulated in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and
     overexpression of IRS-1 in NIH 3T3 cells leads to malignant transformation
     with activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. To
     explore another possible role of IRS-I in hepatocarcinogenesis, we
     examined the capability of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), a
     known negative regulator of hepatocyte growth, to induce programmed cell
     death in the context of IRS-I overexpression. Hep3B HCC cells were stably
     transfected with a retroviral vector containing the IRS-I gene. The
     overexpressed IRS-I protein was highly tyrosyl phosphorylated following
     insulin/insulin- like growth factor I stimulation and led to constitutive
     activation of downstream signal transduction molecules such as
     phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase.
     Although parental Hep3B cells were sensitive to apoptosis, the
     Hep3B-IRS-I-transfected cells acquired resistance to TGF-beta1-induced
     programmed cell death. Our investigations suggest that IRS-I-mediated
     signals may act as survival factors and protect against TGF-beta1-induced
     apoptosis in HCC; this phenomenon may contribute to hepatic oncogenesis.

TI  - Thrombin receptors modulate insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol
     3,4,5-trisphosphate accumulation in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells.
PG  - 347-51
AB  - Thrombin and insulin receptor signaling via phosphoinositide (PI)-specific
     phospholipase C (PLC) and PI 3-kinase was studied in [3H]inositol-labelled
     1321N1 cells. Thrombin stimulated a dramatic, transient activation of PLC
     which is probably mediated via receptors of the 'tethered-ligand' type,
     since it was both reproduced by, and abolished following, pretreatment of
     cells with a synthetic peptide (SFLLRN) corresponding to the ligand domain
     of the human thrombin receptor. However, neither thrombin nor SFLLRN
     stimulated PI 3-kinase. By contrast, insulin did not influence [3H]InsP3
     concentration but stimulated accumulation of [3H]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and
     [3H]PtdIns(3,4)P2, the relative steady-state concentrations of which may
     indicate degradation of [3H]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by 5- and 3-phosphatases. The
     independent coupling of thrombin and insulin receptors to PLC and PI
     3-kinase respectively in 1321N1 cells allowed interactions between these
     systems to be examined. Thus insulin-stimulated [3H]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3
     accumulation was attenuated on co-stimulation of the thrombin receptor,
     whereas concentrations of [3H]PtdIns(3,4)P2 were transiently enhanced but
     then reduced. These results indicate that thrombin receptors in 1321N1
     cells do not activate PI 3-kinase, but can modulate signalling by this
     enzyme.

TI  - A 60-kilodalton protein in rat hepatoma cells overexpressing insulin
     receptor was tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with Syp,
     phophatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Grb2 in an insulin-dependent manner.
PG  - 2649-58
AB  - Tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins is an early and key step
     after activation of the insulin receptor kinase (IRK). The study of the
     properties of these proteins should contribute to our understanding of
     insulin action. In rat hepatoma cells overexpressing human insulin
     receptors (HTC-IR), insulin treatment resulted in rapid tyrosine
     phosphorylation of proteins of 180, 94, 68, and 60 kDa. When lysates from
     insulin-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Syp antibody,
     subsequent immunoblotting identified p65 and p68, which reacted with
     anti-Syp, and p6O and p68, which reacted with antiphosphotyrosine
     antibody. Thus, insulin treatment yielded tyrosine phosphorylation of both
     Syp and a Syp-associated p6O molecule. When lysates from insulin-treated
     cells were adsorbed with a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Syp-Src
     homology-2 (SH2) fusion protein, tyrosine- phosphorylated p6O was
     sequestered. After subjecting lysates to SDS-PAGE, the GST-SypSH2 fusion
     protein was found to bind to p18O, p94, and p6O. Thus, Syp associates
     directly with a 60-kDa IRK substrate via its SH2 domains. Syp-associated
     p6O differed from the 60- to 62-kDa proteins, associating with ras
     guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein, which also underwent modest
     tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin. Preadsorption of cell
     lystates with antibody against the 85-kDa subunit (p85) of
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase substantially reduced the amount of p60
     subsequently immunoprecipitated by anti-Syp. Thus, p60 associates with
     both Syp and p85. The amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated p60 exceeded that
     of p180 in anti-Syp immunoprecipitates, whereas their proportion was
     comparable in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates. Grb2 was also observed in the
     anti-Syp immunoprecipitates. When lysates from insulin-treated cells were
     adsorbed with GST-p85SH2 domains or GST-Grb2, the subsequent eluates
     contained tyrosine-phosphorylated p60, as determined by immunoblotting
     with antiphosphotyrosine. Membrane binding assays using GST fusion
     proteins showed that these associations were direct. Studies in rat liver,
     muscle, and adipose tissue identified insulin-dependent association of
     Syp, Grb2, and p85 with tyrosine-phosphorylated p60 in adipose tissue
     only. We conclude that insulin treatment of HTC-IR cells and rat adipose
     tissue results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p60, which might
     participate in the recruitment of downstream effectors involved in insulin
     signal transduction.

TI  - Neoplastic transformation induced by insulin receptor substrate-1
     overexpression requires an interaction with both Grb2 and Syp signaling
     molecules.
PG  - 14610-6
AB  - The insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is the major intracellular
     substrate of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor
     tyrosine kinase activity, and this protein has been found to be
     overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinomas. IRS-1 contains several
     src homology 2 (SH2) binding motifs that interact following tyrosyl
     phosphorylation with SH2-containing proteins, and this interaction may be
     essential for transmitting the growth signal from the cell surface to the
     nucleus. We have previously reported that overexpression of IRS-1 may
     induce neoplastic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. This study examines the
     role of two SH2-containing molecules, namely the Grb2 adapter and Syp
     tyrosine phosphatase proteins as important components of the cellular
     transforming activity of IRS-1. Mutations of tyrosine 897 in the YVNI
     motif (Y897F) and of tyrosine 1180 in the YIDL motif (Y1180F) reduced the
     intracellular interaction of IRS-1 with Grb2 and Syp proteins,
     respectively. Furthermore, a single mutation at either Phe-897 or Phe-1180
     substantially but not completely reduced IGF-I-dependent transforming
     activity of IRS-1, whereas creation of a double mutation of both tyrosine
     residues (Y897F/Y1180F) strikingly attenuated the transforming activity of
     IRS-1. Stable expression of the IRS-1 mutant constructs in NIH 3T3 cells
     was associated with a lower level of activation of the mitogen-activated
     protein kinase kinase (MAPKK)/MAPK cascade following IGF-I stimulation
     compared with cells stably transfected with the "wild-type" IRS-1 gene.
     These results suggest that IRS-1-induced cellular transformation requires
     an interaction with both Grb2 and Syp signal transduction molecules since
     neither interaction alone appears to be required, and this event
     subsequently leads to activation of the MAPKK/MAPK cascade.

     IRS-1 and SHC by Wortmannin in intact cells.
PG  - 80-4
AB  - Wortmannin is an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3'-kinase, a
     cellular kinase activated by docking to phosphotyrosyl residues of insulin
     receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) that can also phosphorylate serine residues
     on IRS-1 in vitro. After treatment of hepatoma cells with 100 nM
     wortmannin, the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to insulin
     was increased by 38.3 +/- 3.3% while its phosphoserine/threonine content
     was reduced by 19%. Treatment with 1 microM wortmannin further increased
     IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation to 180% of control, while under these
     conditions, tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR substrate p52 Shc was
     reduced to less than 50% of control. Thus, alteration of the serine
     phosphorylation of IR substrates by a wortmannin-sensitive kinase may
     regulate post-insulin receptor signaling pathways by differential
     modulation of their insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation.

     We exchanged the ligand-binding domain of these receptors by the
     ectodomain of trkA and could thus control signaling by the new ligand,
     NGF. We demonstrate here that the tyrosine kinases of c-met, c-ros, c-neu,
     the KGF receptor, and trkA, but not the insulin receptor, induced
     scattering and increased motility of kidney epithelial cells in tissue
     culture. Mutational analysis suggests that SHC binding is essential for
     scattering and increased cell motility induced by trkA. The induction of
     motility in epithelial cells is thus an important feature of various
     receptor tyrosine kinases, which in vivo play a role in embryogenesis and
     metastasis. In contrast, only the c-met receptor promoted branching
     morphogenesis of kidney epithelial cells in three-dimensional matrices,
     which resemble the formation of tubular epithelia in development.
     Interestingly, the ability of c-met to induce morphogenesis could be
     transferred to trkA, when in a novel receptor hybrid COOH-terminal
     sequences of c-met (including Y14 to Y16) were fused to the trkA kinase
     domain. These data demonstrate that tubulogenesis of epithelia is a
     restricted activity of tyrosine kinases, as yet only demonstrated for the
     c-met receptor. We predict the existence of specific substrates that
     mediate this morphogenesis signal.

PG  - 12691-4
AB  - The ret/ptc2 papillary thyroid cancer oncogene, an oncogenic form of the
     c-Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, is the product of a somatic crossover
     event fusing the dimerization domain of the type Ialpha regulatory subunit
     of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (RI) with the tyrosine kinase
     domain of c-Ret. Mitogenic activity of Ret/ptc2 required dimerization via
     the N terminus of RI and a tyrosine residue located C-terminal to the
     kinase core of Ret, Tyr-586 (Durick, K., Yao, V. J., Borrello, M. G.,
     Bongarzone, I., Pierotti, M. A. and Taylor, S. S. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.
     270, 24642-24645). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, Ret/ptc2 binding
     proteins were identified, and the sites of interaction with Ret/ptc2 were
     mapped. The SH2 domains of phospholipase Cgamma and Grb10 were both
     identified, and binding depended on phosphorylation of Tyr-539 and
     Tyr-429, respectively. These interactions, however, were not required for
     mitogenic signaling. The second of the three LIM domains in Enigma (Wu, R.
     Y., and Gill, G. N. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 25085-25090) was also
     identified as a Ret/ptc2 binding domain. Enigma, a 455-residue protein,
     was discovered based on its interaction with the insulin receptor through
     the C-terminal LIM domain. Although the association with Enigma required
     Tyr-586 of Ret/ptc2, the interaction was phosphorylation-independent. In
     contrast to the SH2 interactions, disruption of the interaction with
     Enigma abolished Ret/ptc2 mitogenic signaling, suggesting that LIM domain
     recognition of an unphosphorylated tyrosine-based motif is required for
     Ret signal transduction.

TI  - Cross-coupling between insulin and estrogen receptor in human
     neuroblastoma cells.
PG  - 499-507
AB  - Insulin is a well known mitotic agent for neuroblastoma cells. Human
     SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with the estrogen receptor,
     however, undergo growth arrest and differentiation when treated with
     insulin. These effects were shown to be due to an insulin-dependent
     activation of the unliganded estrogen receptor. Here, we demonstrate that
     this activation involves the AF-2 COOH-terminal domain of the estrogen
     receptor and that the communication between estrogen and insulin receptor
     systems occurs via selected and specific transduction signals. In fact, by
     the use of dominant negative and dominant positive mutants we demonstrate
     that p21ras is essential for insulin and estrogen receptor coupling. With
     pharmacological tools, we prove that PI 3'kinase does not contribute to
     this cross-talk and that protein kinase C triggers transduction signals
     that act in synergism with p21ras. These results prove the intricacy of
     all these intracellular paths of communication. The finding that, in
     neuroblastoma cells, selected signal transduction systems are involved in
     the insulin-dependent activation of estrogen receptor is of particular
     interest considering that estrogen receptor might restrict the role played
     by insulin during the differentiation of neural cells and interfere with
     its proliferative potential while allowing its regulation of other
     functions related to cell survival.

TI  - Sphingomyelinase and ceramide suppress insulin-induced tyrosine
     phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1.
PG  - 9895-7
AB  - The sphingomyelin pathway is a newly described signal transduction pathway
     mediating the action of several cytokines including tumor necrosis
     factor-alpha (TNF). TNF was recently shown to interfere with
     insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor
     substrate-1 (IRS-1). In this work we examined the possible effect of
     direct activation of the sphingomyelin pathway on insulin-induced tyrosine
     phosphorylation of IRS-1. Incubation of the insulin-sensitive rat hepatoma
     Fao cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) that causes membrane
     hydrolysis of sphingomyelin led to a time- and dose-dependent decrease in
     insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. The effect was apparent
     after 10 min of incubation and with a dose of 10 milliunits/ml SMase. It
     was not associated with a decrease in insulin receptor
     autophosphorylation. In addition, SMase treatment interrupted the
     association of the 85-kDa catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol
     3-kinase with IRS-1. A similar impact on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation
     was observed after addition of cell-permeable ceramide analogs (C2 and
     C6). Comparable changes in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and
     electrophoretic mobility were found after exposure of cells to either TNF,
     SMase, or ceramide. Our findings suggest that TNF may utilize the
     sphingomyelin pathway in its effect on the insulin-stimulated tyrosine
     phosphorylation of IRS-1.

PG  - 31-8
AB  - In order to examine alterations in the phosphorylation state of proteins
     involved in insulin action that might accompany the reduced growth state
     of density-arrested cells, we measured the insulin-stimulated
     phosphorylation of the receptor and high M(r) cellular substrates of the
     receptor kinase in rat hepatoma cells at different cell densities. As cell
     density increased from 2 x 10(5) to 3.2 x 10(6) per 35-mm well, the rate
     of DNA synthesis fell to 22% of control, while insulin-stimulated tyrosine
     phosphorylation of high M(r) receptor substrates ("pp185") was enhanced to
     198% of control, without a change in the abundance of insulin receptor
     substrate (IRS)-1 protein. In anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates, tyrosine
     phosphorylation was increased by only 30%, suggesting that increased
     tyrosine phosphorylation of additional high M(r) proteins (e.g., IRS-2)
     accounted for much of the observed increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of
     the receptor substrates. In spite of increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
     IRS-1 and total pp185-related proteins, however, cells studied at high
     growth density exhibited a 25% decrease in IRS-1-associated
     phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity and only a 39% increase in
     phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity in antiphosphotyrosine
     immunoprecipitates. To explore the potential role of hepatic
     protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) in the hyperphosphorylation of
     pp185 proteins, we found by immunoblotting that at high cell density the
     intracellular PTPase PTP1B and the transmembrane PTPase LAR were reduced
     in abundance by 49% and 55%, respectively, while the abundance of the
     SH2-domain containing PTPase SH-PTP2 was increased by 48%. These data
     demonstrate that the attenuation of post-receptor signaling by insulin in
     hepatoma cells at increasing growth density involves changes in endogenous
     substrate phosphorylation which may result from alterations in specific
     PTPases implicated in the regulation of the insulin action pathway.

     esculentum (buckwheat) on various protein kinases involved in signal
     transduction was examined. We observed that buckwheat contains red
     fluorescent compounds having photosensitizing properties.
     Spectrophotometric analysis of the extract has indicated structural
     similarity to hypericin. Dose- and light-dependent inhibition of various
     protein kinases was observed. The purified buckwheat extract strongly
     inhibited two receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases (EGF-R and
     Ins-R) and a Ser/Thr kinase (PK-C) at an ng/ml concentration range.
     Selectivity was exhibited as a decreased sensitivity to cytosolic PTKs and
     protein kinase CK-2. The protein kinases are important components of the
     signal transduction pathway. Aberration of signal transduction is a
     hallmark of several proliferative diseases. Our results indicate that
     photosensitizing compounds in buckwheat are potential antiproliferative
     agents.

     cancer.
PG  - 886-90
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a multisite docking protein
     implicated in mitogenic signaling following activation of the insulin and
     insulin-like growth factor I receptors. In the present study we
     characterized IRS-1 expression in human pancreatic cancer. Northern blot
     analysis revealed high levels of IRS-1 mRNA transcripts in ASPC-1 and MIA
     PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cell lines, and lower levels in COLO-357,
     PANC-1, and T3M4 cells. Immunoblotting with anti-IRS-1 antibodies
     indicated that IRS-1 protein levels paralleled IRS-1 mRNA levels. Analysis
     of RNA isolated from normal and cancerous human pancreatic tissues
     indicated that 7 of 16 pancreatic cancer samples overexpressed IRS-1 mRNA
     transcripts by comparison with the normal pancreas and that insulin mRNA
     levels were abundant in many tumors. These data suggest that IRS-1
     contributes to the signaling pathways that lead to excessive growth
     stimulation in human pancreatic cancer.

TI  - Overexpression of human insulin receptor substrate 1 induces cellular
     transformation with activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases.
PG  - 943-51
AB  - The receptor insulin substrate 1 protein (IRS-1) is a specific substrate
     for insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. Expression and tyrosyl
     phosphorylation of IRS-1 play an important role during normal hepatocyte
     growth, and the gene is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue.
     We determined if IRS-1 overexpression directly contributes to cellular
     transformation. The human IRS-1 gene was subcloned into a mammalian
     expression vector driven by the cytomegalovirus early promoter. NIH 3T3
     cells transiently transfected with this vector subsequently developed
     transformed foci. Several stably transfected cell lines were established,
     and they grew efficiently under low-serum conditions and formed colonies
     when plated in soft agar. Cell lines overexpressing IRS-1 displayed
     increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 and association with Grb2 but
     not with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase. Since Grb2 is
     a component of the son-of-sevenless-Ras pathway and upstream in the
     mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, enzymatic activities of
     the major components of this cascade, such as MAPK kinase and MAPK were
     evaluated and found to be substantially increased in three independent
     cell lines with IRS-1 protein overexpression. Such cells, when injected
     into nude mice, were highly tumorigenic, and there may be a correlation
     between the degree of MAPK activation and tumor growth rate. This report
     describes the generation of a transformed phenotype by overexpression of a
     molecule without a catalytic domain far upstream in the signal
     transduction cascade and suggests that prolonged activation of MAPKs by
     this mechanism may be one of the molecular events related to
     hepatocellular transformation.

TI  - Role of insulin-like growth factors in autocrine growth of human
     retinoblastoma Y79 cells.
PG  - 523-32
AB  - In this study, we have demonstrated that human retinoblastoma Y79 cells
     produce insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) type I and type II and release
     them into the medium. We have also ascertained, by means of competitive
     studies and cross-linking procedure, that Y79 cells contain the type-I IGF
     receptor (IGF-IR). Furthermore, surface-bound IGF-I is internalised by the
     receptor, then degraded to amino acids. Insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II caused
     down-regulation of IGF-IR; the effect is concentration and time dependent.
     Scatchard analysis demonstrated that incubation with insulin markedly
     decreased the binding capacity measured for IGF-I while the apparent Kd
     value calculated for IGF-I binding was not significantly modified. IGF-I,
     IGF-II and insulin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-IR. Tyrosine
     phosphorylation of this receptor with, however, a less strong signal, was
     detectable even in cells cultured in serum-free medium without the
     addition of any exogenous growth factor. Similar results have been found
     concerning the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1
     (IRS 1). Tyrosine phosphorylation of both IGF-IR and IRS 1, either under
     basal conditions or after stimulation with growth factors, was strongly
     inhibited when alpha-IR3, a monoclonal antibody to IGF-IR, was added to
     the culture. IGF-I was capable of inducing Y79 cell proliferation and its
     effect was entirely inhibited by the addition of alpha-IR3. This antibody
     also markedly reduced the proliferation of Y79 cells cultured in
     serum-free medium not supplemented with stimulatory factors. Our results
     indicate that IGF-I and IGF-IR mediate an autocrine growth mechanism in
     Y79 cells.

TI  - A Grb2-associated docking protein in EGF- and insulin-receptor signalling.
PG  - 560-4
AB  - The protein Grb2 plays a central role in signalling by receptor
     protein-tyrosine kinases, where its SH2 domain binds to the receptor and
     its two SH3 domains link to effectors. One target effector is Sos, so Grb2
     links receptor protein-tyrosine kinases with the Ras signalling pathway.
     The SH3 domains can also couple to other signalling proteins, including
     Vav, c-Abl and dynamin. We have identified several bands in glial and
     medulloblastoma tumours that are recognized by Grb2 but these did not
     correspond to any known protein. Here we use recombinant Grb2 to isolate a
     complementary DNA called Gab1 (for Grb2-associated binder-1). Gab1 shares
     amino-acid homology and several structural features with IRS-1
     (insulin-receptor substrate-1; refs 6,7), is a substrate of the EGF and
     insulin receptors, and can act as a docking protein for several
     SH2-containing proteins. Over-expression of Gab1 enhances cell growth and
     results in transformation. We conclude that Gab1 is a new protein in EGF
     and insulin receptor signalling which could integrate signals from
     different systems.

TI  - Tumorigenic and mitogenic capacities are reduced in transfected
     fibroblasts expressing mutant insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I
     receptors. The role of tyrosine residues 1250, 1251, and 1316 in the
     carboxy-terminus of the IGF-I receptor.
PG  - 410-7
AB  - Regulation of ligand-mediated signal transduction through transmembrane
     tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors involves phosphorylation of
     tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the receptor. The
     insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor contains three tyrosine
     residues in the carboxy-terminal domain at positions 1250, 1251, and 1316.
     Of these, only the tyrosine at position 1316 is conserved in the
     homologous position of the insulin receptor. Mutational analysis was used
     to study the role of these tyrosines in specific outcomes of
     IGF-I-mediated signal transduction. Mutations in the human IGF-I receptor
     were either replacement of tyrosines 1250 and 1251 with phenylalanine and
     histidine (yyFH), respectively, or replacement of the conserved distal
     tyrosine (position 1316) with phenylalanine (yCF). The yyFH mutation
     results in an IGF-I receptor with the amino acids found in the homologous
     position of the human insulin receptor. Cells overexpressing mutated IGF-I
     receptors were compared with cells expressing only endogenous IGF-I
     receptors or overexpressing wild-type IGF-I receptors. The ability of yyFH
     mutant IGF-I receptors to autophosphorylate the beta-subunit or
     phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate-1 was not significantly different
     from wild-type type IGF-I receptors. However, one or both of the proximal
     tyrosine residues (positions 1250 and 1251) in the carboxy-terminus of the
     IGF-I receptor are essential for IGF-I-stimulation of mitogenic and
     tumorigenic pathways. IGF-I-induced mitogenesis, measured as thymidine
     incorporation and cellular proliferation, was abrogated in cells
     overexpressing mutant IGF-I receptors with replacement of the proximal
     double tyrosines (positions 1250 and 1251). Fibroblasts expressing this
     mutant IGF-I receptor formed fewer tumors than the negative control cells,
     whereas cells expressing wild-type IGF-I receptors formed large tumors in
     all recipient mice injected. Conversely, cells expressing mutant IGF-I
     receptors with only the conserved distal tyrosine (position 1316) replaced
     had slightly reduced IGF-I-stimulated beta-subunit autophosphorylation,
     thymidine incorporation, and cellular proliferation when compared with
     cells expressing wild-type receptors. Phosphorylation of insulin receptor
     substrate-1 by the yCF mutant receptors was not impaired. Despite the
     ability of these mutant receptors to stimulate mitogenic growth,
     fibroblasts expressing this mutant receptor were also incapable of forming
     tumors in recipient nude mice. The distal tyrosine (position 1316) of the
     IGF-I receptor is crucial for tumor formation but is not essential for
     IGF-I stimulated mitogenesis. Thus, the tyrosine moieties in the
     carboxy-terminus of the IGF-I receptor participate in the signal
     transduction pathways that affect the mitogenic and tumorigenic potentials
     of cells expressing mutant IGF-I receptors.

TI  - The transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase LAR modulates signaling by
     multiple receptor tyrosine kinases.
PG  - 748-54
AB  - Antisense-mediated suppression of the transmembrane protein-tyrosine
     phosphatase (PTPase) LAR has been shown previously to increase
     insulin-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activation
     by greater than 300% in the rat hepatoma cell line McA-RH7777. Here,
     insulin-dependent insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activation was examined
     with recombinant insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) as the substrate and
     shown to be 3-fold greater in cells with suppressed LAR levels. Consistent
     with a receptor level effect, in vivo insulin-dependent tyrosine
     phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and Shc was increased by a similar 3-fold
     with LAR suppression. These increases in IRS-1 and Shc phosphorylation
     were paralleled by increases in insulin-dependent PI 3-kinase association
     with IRS-1 and activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Reduced LAR levels
     also resulted in increases of over 300% and 250% in epidermal growth
     factor (EGF)- and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-dependent receptor
     autophosphorylation, respectively, as well as a severalfold increase in
     substrate tyrosine phosphorylation. In a post-receptor response, EGF- and
     HGF-dependent MAP kinase activation was increased by 300% and 350%,
     respectively, with LAR suppression. Similarly, growth factor-dependent PI
     3-kinase activation was increased in LAR antisense expressing cells when
     compared to null vector expressing cells. These results demonstrate that
     the transmembrane PTPase LAR modulates ligand-dependent activation of at
     least three receptor tyrosine kinases.

TI  - Effect of tyrosine mutations on the kinase activity and transforming
     potential of an oncogenic human insulin-like growth factor I receptor.
PG  - 160-7
AB  - The tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of an oncogenic human insulin-like
     growth factor I receptor (gag-IGFR) were systematically mutated to
     phenylalanines to investigate the role of those tyrosines in the enzymatic
     and biological function of the gag-IGFR. Our results indicate that
     tyrosines 1131, 1135, 1136, and 1221 are important for the receptor
     protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. However, mutation of Tyr-1136 only
     slightly affects the kinase activity but dramatically reduces the
     transforming ability and overall substrate phosphorylation, in particular,
     annexin II, which is strongly phosphorylated by the gag-IGFR but not by
     the Phe-1136 mutant. Single mutation of either Tyr-943 or Tyr-950 resulted
     in significantly reduced phosphorylation of the receptor but not on its
     PTK activity or transforming ability. Tyr-950 together with its
     surrounding sequence is involved in mediating the interaction between the
     gag-IGFR and insulin receptor substrate 1. Our data also suggest that
     Tyr-1316 is involved in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma, which
     is, however, not important for cell transforming activity. Overall, our
     study has identified several tyrosine residues of IGFR important for its
     PTK activity and substrate interaction. The transforming potential of the
     gag-IGFR correlates well with its ability to phosphorylate overall
     cellular substrates and to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase via
     insulin receptor substrate 1.

TI  - IGF-I receptor signalling: lessons from the somatotroph.
PG  - 189-215; discussion 215-6
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) is a major feedback regulator of
     pituitary GH secretion, with defined actions occurring at both the
     hypothalamus and pituitary. The IGF-I gene is expressed in the anterior
     pituitary in a GH-dependent manner thus providing for both endocrine-as
     well as autocrine-mediated GH regulation. In turn, IGF-I selectively and
     specifically inhibits GH gene transcription and secretion, its attenuating
     effects on nascent GH mRNA synthesis being demonstrable within 1 h.
     Binding of IGF-I to its pituitary cell surface receptor is followed by
     rapid activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor
     beta-subunit and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1).
     Structure-function studies of the human IGF-I receptor were performed in
     stable, GH-secreting transfectants expressing either the cDNA encoding the
     wild-type (WT) human IGF receptor and exhibiting enhanced IGF-I
     responsiveness, or cDNAs encoding IGF-I receptor mutants and a truncated,
     kinase-deficient receptor (952STOP). 950Tyr situated on the submembrane
     receptor domain was found to be critical for transducing the IGF-I signal
     to the GH gene. IGF-I failed to suppress GH secretion by signalling
     endogenous rat IGF-I receptors when hybrid receptors were formed with
     kinase-deficient human receptors and rat hemi-receptors. This dominant
     negative effect on hormone secretion was also evidenced when mitogenic
     IGF-I signals were blocked in vitro and in vivo by these hybrid receptors.
     Using similar doses of IGF-I, the IGF-I receptor cell transfectants also
     demonstrated ligand-dependent activation of ERKs in pituitary cells. In
     conclusion, the pituitary IGF-I receptor mediates the negative feedback
     regulation of GH. Thus, IGF-I receptor mass may determine GH responses to
     malnutrition, pregnancy, and refeeding. IGF-I receptor mutations may also
     prove useful to abrogate the growth of IGF-I-dependent tumors. These
     structure-function studies of the human IGF-I receptor provide mechanistic
     insights into both metabolic control of the GH axis, as well as target
     tissue proliferative characteristics.

     chain, and IL-4 induces the phosphorylation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase in
     human colon carcinoma cells.
PG  - 30829-36
AB  - We have previously reported on the expression of interleukin-4 receptors
     (IL-4R) on many human epithelial cancer cells; however, the binding
     characteristics, structure, function, and signal transduction through the
     IL-4R in cancer cells is not known. IL-4 binding characteristics were
     determined in human colon carcinoma cell lines by a 125I-IL-4 binding
     assay, which demonstrated that the HT-29 and WiDr colon cancer cell lines
     expressed high affinity IL-4R (Kd = 200 pM). Cross-linking experiments
     revealed a major band of 140 kDa and a broad band at 70 kDa. While the
     common gamma chain of IL-2R is associated with IL-4R in immune cells and
     is similar in size to the 70-kDa protein, this chain was not expressed in
     these colon cancer cells. Interestingly, IL-13, which has many functions
     similar to IL-4, inhibited 125I-IL-4 binding to both the 140- and 70-kDa
     molecules. Next, we investigated the mechanism of IL-4-induced signal
     transduction in colon cancer cells. After stimulation with IL-4, a 170-kDa
     band was primarily phosphorylated within 1 min of exposure and was
     identified as insulin receptor substrate-1. In addition, by
     immunoprecipitation assay, three other phosphorylated bands were
     identified as JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2 tyrosine kinases. The phosphorylation
     of JAK1 and JAK2 was induced by IL-4 stimulation; however, Tyk2 was
     constitutively phosphorylated, and IL-4 treatment further augmented this
     phosphorylation. The kinetics and in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that
     JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2 were phosphorylated within minutes and that JAK1 and
     JAK2 were activated after IL-4 exposure. Contrary to observations in
     immune cells. JAK3 mRNA was neither detected in colon cancer cells nor did
     IL-4 treatment cause phosphorylation of JAK3. These data indicate that in
     colon carcinoma cells JAK1, JAK2, Tyk2, and insulin receptor substrate-1
     are phosphorylated after IL-4 stimulation. In addition, as is the case in
     lymphoid cells, IL-4 activated and phosphorylated signal transducers and
     activators of transcription (IL-4-STAT or STAT-6) protein in both colon
     cancer cell lines. These results indicate that the IL-4R complex is
     composed of different subunits in different tissues and shares a component
     with the IL-13R complex. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time
     that like its family members (e.g. IL-3 and GM-CSF), IL-4 can
     phosphorylate and activate JAK-2 kinase.

     cells.
PG  - 59-67
AB  - Vanadate and insulin both function as unique complete mitogens for
     SV40-transformed 3T3T cells, designated CSV3-1, but not for nontransformed
     3T3T cells. The mitogenic effects induced by vanadate and insulin in
     CSV3-1 cells are mediated by different signaling mechanisms. For example,
     vanadate does not stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin
     receptor beta-subunit nor the 170 kDa insulin receptor substrate-1.
     Instead, vanadate induces a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of
     55 and 64 kDa proteins that is not observed in insulin-stimulated CSV3-1
     cells. Perhaps most interestingly, vandate-induced mitogenesis is
     associated with the selective induction of c-jun and junB expression
     without significantly inducing c-fos or c-myc. Furthermore, treatment of
     CSV3-1 cells with genistein abolishes the effects of vanadate on protein
     tyrosine phosphorylation and c-jun induction. These and related data
     suggest that modulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and c-jun and
     junB expression may serve the critical roles in mediating vandate-induced
     mitogenesis in SV40-transformed cells.

PG  - 409-15
AB  - We have characterized an insulin-dependent T-cell lymphoma, LB, devoid of
     IGF-I receptor, which undergoes insulin stimulation and cell proliferation
     both in vitro and in vivo. In these cells, the mitogenic response can be
     evoked only through binding of insulin to its own receptor. This lymphoma
     is thus a good model for studying the molecular mechanisms involved in
     insulin mitogenicity. The high level of activated Ras in LB cells, even
     under nonproliferative conditions, shows that activation of Ras is
     insufficient for mitogenicity. It has been suggested earlier that separate
     pathways of signal transduction may emerge from Ras. The decision to
     activate a certain signaling pathway may depend on the activation state of
     other signaling routes in the cell. This may be the case in LB cells,
     where a signaling component activated by insulin works in concert with the
     Ras signaling pathway to induce mitogenesis. Yet it is still unclear
     whether activated Ras is a prerequisite for the insulin-induced response
     in LB cells.

TI  - The B isoform of the insulin receptor signals more efficiently than the A
     isoform in HepG2 cells.
PG  - 20816-23
AB  - We have demonstrated previously that dexamethasone treatment of HepG2
     cells caused an enhancement of insulin's metabolic effects (Kosaki, A.,
     and Webster, N. J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 21990-21996). This
     correlated with increased expression of the mRNA encoding the B isoform of
     the insulin receptor (IR). In the present study, we have demonstrated that
     dexamethasone treatment caused in addition an enhancement in
     insulin-stimulated immediate-early gene expression (c-fos and egr-1).
     Dexamethasone treatment caused an increase in in vivo IR
     autophosphorylation and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)
     phosphorylation both early events in the insulin signaling pathway.
     Furthermore, the IRS-1 phosphorylation was distinctly left shifted,
     although the level of IRS-1 protein was unchanged. Total cellular tyrosine
     phosphatase activity was unaltered when assayed with 32P-labeled IR and
     IRS-1. Studies in vitro on wheat-germ agglutinin-purified receptors showed
     that the B isoform of the IR had increased kinase activity both toward
     itself and the exogenous substrates poly.glu4:tyr1 and recombinant IRS-1
     protein. In addition, two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps
     indicated that the B isoform has an additional phosphopeptide that is not
     seen for the A isoform. In conclusion, it appears that the B isoform of
     the IR signals more efficiently than the A isoform in HepG2 cells.

     protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B in negative regulation of the insulin
     action pathway.
PG  - 20503-8
AB  - Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) have been postulated to balance
     the steady-state phosphorylation and the activation state of the insulin
     receptor and its substrate proteins. To explore whether PTP1B, a widely
     expressed, non-receptor-type PTPase, regulates insulin signaling, we used
     osmotic shock to load rat KRC-7 hepatoma cells with affinity-purified
     neutralizing antibodies that immunoprecipitate and inactivate the
     enzymatic activity of recombinant rat PTP1B in vitro. In cells loaded with
     PTP1B antibody, insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis and phosphatidylinositol
     3'-kinase activity were increased by 42% and 38%, respectively, compared
     with control cells loaded with preimmune IgG (p < 0.005). In order to
     characterize the potential site(s) of action of PTP1B in insulin
     signaling, we also determined that insulin-stimulated receptor
     autophosphorylation and insulin receptor substrate 1 tyrosine
     phosphorylation were increased 2.2- and 2.0-fold, respectively, and that
     insulin-stimulated receptor kinase activity toward an exogenous peptide
     substrate was increased by 57% in the PTP1B antibody-loaded cells. Osmotic
     loading did not alter the cellular content of PTP1B protein, suggesting
     that the antibody acts in the cell by sterically blocking catalytic
     interactions between PTP1B and its physiological substrates. These studies
     demonstrate that PTP1B has a role in the negative regulation of insulin
     signaling and acts, at least in part, directly at the level of the insulin
     receptor. These results also show that insulin signaling can be enhanced
     by the inhibition of specific PTPases, a maneuver that has potential
     clinical relevance in the treatment of insulin resistance and Type II
     diabetes mellitus.

TI  - UV activation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity.
PG  - 561-9
AB  - The exposure of mammalian cells to ultraviolet radiation (UV) may lead to
     DNA damage resulting in mutation and thus possibly cancer, while
     irradiation can further act as a potent tumor promoter. In addition UV
     induces p21ras-mediated signalling leading to activation of transcription
     factors such as AP-1 and NF-kappa B, as well as activation of the Src
     tyrosine kinase. This 'UV-response' has been well studied in mammalian
     cells and furthermore is conserved in yeast, however the most upstream
     components of this signal transduction pathway have remained elusive. Here
     we show that UV rapidly activates both the EGF receptor and insulin
     receptor, as shown by tyrosine phosphorylation of these receptors. We
     demonstrate that this activation is due to autophosphorylation as it only
     occurs in cells containing receptors with a functional kinase domain. We
     have further analysed the propagation of the UV-induced signal to
     downstream events such as, IRS-1 and Shc tyrosine phosphorylation,
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, leukotriene synthesis, MAP
     kinase activation and gene induction all of which are activated by UV
     irradiation. Importantly, we demonstrate that in cells expressing a
     'kinase-dead' receptor mutant the UV-response is inhibited, blocking
     leukotriene synthesis, MAP kinase activation and transcriptional
     induction. Furthermore, prior-stimulation of cells with UV appears to
     reduce further responsiveness to addition of growth factor suggesting a
     common signaling pathway. These data demonstrate a critical role for
     receptor-mediated events in regulating the response mammalian cells to UV
     exposure.

AB  - Mouse embryo cells expressing a wild-type number of insulin-like growth
     factor I receptors (IGF-IR) (W cells) can be transformed either by simian
     virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 T) or by overexpressed insulin receptor
     substrate 1 (IRS-1), singly transfected. Neither SV40 T antigen nor IRS-1,
     individually, can transform mouse embryo cells with a targeted disruption
     of the IGF-IR genes (R- cells). However, cotransfection of SV40 T antigen
     and IRS-1 does transform R- cells. In this study, using different
     antibodies and different cell lines, we found that SV40 T antigen and
     IRS-1 are coprecipitated from cell lysates in a specific fashion,
     regardless of whether the lysates are immunoprecipitated with an antibody
     to SV40 T antigen or an antibody to IRS-1. The same antibody to SV40 T
     antigen, however, fails to coprecipitate another substrate of IGF-IR, the
     transforming protein Shc, and two other signal-transducing molecules, Grb2
     and Sos. Finally, an SV40 T antigen lacking the amino-terminal 250 amino
     acids fails to coprecipitate IRS-1 and also fails to transform R- cells
     overexpressing mouse IRS-1. These experiments indicate that IRS-1
     associates with SV40 T antigen and that this association plays a critical
     role in the combined ability of these proteins to transform R- cells. This
     finding is discussed in light of the crucial role of the IGF-IR in the
     establishment and maintenance of the transformed phenotype.

TI  - Herbimycin A induces the 20 S proteasome- and ubiquitin-dependent
     degradation of receptor tyrosine kinases.
PG  - 16580-7
AB  - Herbimycin A is an ansamycin antibiotic isolated as an agent that reverses
     morphological transformation induced by v-src. Although herbimycin A is
     widely used as a tool for inhibiting multiple tyrosine protein kinases and
     tyrosine kinase-activated signal transduction, its mechanism of action is
     not well defined and includes a decrease in both tyrosine kinase protein
     levels and activity (Uehara, Y., Murakami, Y., Sugimoto, Y., and Mizuno,
     S. (1989) Cancer Res. 49, 780-785). We now show that herbimycin A induces
     a profound decrease in the total cellular activity of transmembrane
     tyrosine kinase receptors, such as insulin-like growth factor, insulin,
     and epidermal growth factor receptors. A substantial proportion of the in
     vivo inhibition could be explained by an increase in the rate of
     degradation. The enhanced degradation of insulin-like growth
     factor-insulin receptor was prevented by inhibitors of the 20S proteasome,
     whereas neither lysosomotropic agents nor general serine- and
     cysteine-protease inhibitors were active in preventing receptor
     degradation induced by herbimycin A. Moreover, in a temperature-sensitive
     mutant cell line defective in the E1-catalyzed activation of ubiquitin,
     herbimycin A treatment at the restrictive temperature did not result in
     the degradation of insulin receptor. These results suggest that herbimycin
     A represents a novel class of drug that targets the degradation of
     tyrosine kinases by the 20S proteasome. The ubiquitin dependence of this
     process indicates that this degradation of tyrosine kinases might involve
     the 20S proteasome as the proteolytic core of the ubiquitin-dependent 26S
     protease.

TI  - Differential pathways of insulin action upon the hepatitis B surface
     antigen gene expression and cell proliferation in human hepatoma cells.
PG  - 2922-7
AB  - We have shown previously that insulin at the physiological concentration
     suppresses hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) gene expression in cultured
     human hepatoma Hep3B cells, and this suppression phenomenon is concomitant
     with the stimulation of cell proliferation. We have now examined whether
     these two distinct insulin actions on the Hep3B cells are mediated through
     the same or different signaling pathways. After prolonged treatment with
     high concentration of tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoyl
     phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-alpha) level in
     the Hep3B cells was diminished and could not be detected by Western blot
     analysis. Under this condition, TPA treatment has no effect on the number
     or affinity of the insulin receptor on Hep3B cells. However,
     insulin-stimulated cell proliferation was completely abolished in the
     PKC-alpha depleted cells. In contrast, insulin still suppressed HBsAg gene
     expression with the same ED50 (approximately 0.5 nM) as the control cell.
     The induction of proto-oncogene egr-1 (early-growth-regulatory-1) by
     insulin and TPA under similar conditions were also examined. Both insulin
     and TPA stimulated egr-1 gene expression up to 10-fold in the control
     cell, but neither of these two agents showed any effect on egr-1 gene
     expression in the PKC-alpha down-regulated Hep3B cells. These observations
     indicate that the PKC-alpha may be involved in the insulin induced egr-1
     expression and cell proliferation but not in the insulin suppressed HBsAg
     gene expression in human hepatoma cells.

TI  - pp125FAK in human melanocytes and melanoma: expression and
     phosphorylation.
PG  - 197-203
AB  - Focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase which
     colocalizes with integrins to focal contacts, sites where multiple
     proteins interact to regulate the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton.
     Autophosphorylation and activation of pp125FAK occur after integrin
     clustering or cell adhesion to ligands through cognate integrin receptors
     and are postulated to mediate integrin signaling events. In this report we
     examined pp125FAK expression and phosphorylation in normal human
     melanocytes, an adherent human metastatic melanoma cell line (SKMEL28),
     and a nonadherent human metastatic melanoma cell line (SKMEL1). We show
     that SKMEL28 cells express constitutively phosphorylated pp125FAK and that
     pp125FAK phosphorylation in melanocytes is induced by phorbol esters and
     growth factors present in melanocyte growth medium. Focal adhesion kinase
     phosphorylation could be enhanced by b1 integrin-activating antibodies in
     human melanocytes, but not in SKMEL28 cells. In contrast with SKMEL28
     cells, constitutive phosphorylation of pp125FAK was not observed in SKMEL1
     cells, and incubation with activating b1 integrin antibodies had no effect
     on pp125FAK phosphorylation. Absence of pp125FAK phosphorylation in SKMEL1
     cells was not due to lack of expression of pp125FAK, as shown by
     immunoprecipitation of the pp125FAK protein from cell lysates. However, b1
     integrin expression was significantly less in SKMEL1 cells than in human
     melanocytes and SKMEL28 cells. This study further supports the importance
     of integrins in pp125FAK-mediated signaling and indicates that
     transformation-related changes in pp125FAK phosphorylation exist in human
     melanocytes and melanoma cells.

PG  - 579-83
AB  - Activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor by
     autophosphorylation leads to phosphorylation of cellular substrates on
     tyrosine. Thus far, the best characterized is the insulin receptor
     substrate (IRS) 1, which has been proposed to serve as a docking protein
     for other molecules involved in signal transduction. A number of other
     proteins that become phosphorylated in response to insulin have been
     identified, some of which are reported to be tissue-specific. A 60 kDa
     phosphoprotein has been detected in adipocytes after insulin stimulation
     [Lavan and Lienhard (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 5921-5928]. We have
     identified a protein of similar molecular mass in rat hepatoma cells
     transfected with the human insulin receptor. The 60 kDa protein in
     hepatoma cells is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin in a
     dose-dependent manner, with maximal phosphorylation occurring at 50 nM
     insulin. Although the dose-response of p60 phosphorylation mirrors that of
     IRS-1, the time course is slightly slower, with maximal phosphorylation
     observed 5 min after addition of insulin. Like the adipocyte protein, the
     60 kDa protein detected in liver cells binds to the SH2 domain of the p85
     regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but not to other SH2
     domains. Binding of p60 to p85 is similar to the interaction between p85
     and IRS-1 in that a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide containing the YVXM
     motif can inhibit the association. The presence of this 60 kDa
     tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in adipocytes and hepatoma cells suggests
     that it represents another important intermediate in the insulin-receptor
     signal-transduction pathway.

     Similarities and differences in signal transduction with interleukin-4 and

PG  - 12286-96
AB  - Interleukin-13 (IL-13) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) are related in structure
     and function and are thought to share a common receptor component. We have
     investigated the signal transduction pathways activated by these two
     growth factors, as well as insulin, in cell-lines and primary cells of
     lymphohemopoietic origin. All three factors induced the tyrosine
     phosphorylation of a protein of 170 kDa (p170), which coimmunoprecipitated
     with the p85 subunit of P13'-kinase, via high affinity interactions
     mediated by the SH2 domains of p85. Antibodies raised against the entire
     insulin-receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) protein immunoprecipitated p170 much
     less efficiently than they did IRS-1 from 3T3 cells. However, antibodies
     directed against the conserved pleckstrin homology domain of IRS-1
     immunoprecipitated both p170 and IRS-1 with similar efficiency, suggesting
     they share structural similarities in this region. In lymphohemopoietic
     cells, IL-13, IL-4, and insulin failed to induce increased tyrosine
     phosphorylation of Shc, or its association with grb2, modification of
     Sos1, or activation of erk-1 and erk-2 mitogen-activated protein kinases,
     suggesting that p170 mediates downstream pathways distinct from those
     mediated by IRS-1. Both IL-13 and IL-4 induced low levels of tyrosine
     phosphorylation of Tyk-2 and Jak-1. IL-4 also activated the Jak-3-kinase,
     but, despite other similarities, IL-13 did not. Insulin failed to activate
     any of the known members of the Janus family of kinases. In that Jak-3 is
     reported to associate with the IL-2 gamma c chain, these data suggest that
     the IL-13 receptor does not utilize this subunit. However, both IL-13 and
     IL-4 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-4-140 kDa receptor chain,
     suggesting that this is a component of both receptors in these cells and
     accounts for the similarities in signaling pathways shared by IL-13 and
     IL-4.

PG  - 557-62
AB  - The role of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) in cellular
     transformation was studied in R- cells, which are 3T3-like fibroblasts
     derived from mouse embryos with a targeted disruption of the insulin-like
     growth factor I receptor gene. These cells cannot be transformed by
     oncogenes that readily transform cells originating from wild-type
     littermate embryos (or other 3T3-like cells). In the present study, we
     demonstrate that in R- cells, the overexpression of the functional IRS-1
     protein was sufficient to induce a mitogenic response to insulin but did
     not promote transformation, as measured by colony formation in soft agar.
     The coexpression of IRS-1 and the SV40 T antigen, however, induced
     transformation. Conversely, expression of an antisense IRS-1 RNA reversed
     the transformed phenotype in wild-type cells carrying the T antigen. Since
     the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor, by itself, is fully
     transforming, we propose the hypothesis that the transforming competence
     of this receptor is based on at least two signaling pathways, one of which
     is IRS-1-dependent, whereas the other(s) can be substituted with the SV40
     T antigen.

     molecule linking the insulin receptor to insulin receptor substrate 1.
PG  - 435-42
AB  - After insulin stimulation of cells, signaling complexes are formed,
     containing the insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate-1
     (IRS-1), and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. To study the nature of these
     complexes, we employed purified IR, recombinant IRS-1, antibodies to IR
     and IRS-1, and fusion proteins containing the two SH2 domains of p85. In
     intact cells, insulin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both the IR
     and IRS-1. Both of these proteins were immunoprecipitated with antibodies
     to p85. Also, fusion proteins containing the two SH2 domains of p85
     directly precipitated both the IR and IRS-1. Next, these signaling
     complexes were reconstituted in vitro with purified IR, recombinant IRS-1,
     and the two SH2 domains of p85. In the presence of both SH2 domains of
     p85, the IR associated with IRS-1. Other data, both in intact cells and in
     vitro, demonstrated that N- and C-terminal SH2 domains of p85 had
     preferential binding affinities for the IR and IRS-1, respectively.
     Studies with an IR mutant truncated in the C terminus indicated that the
     C-terminal phosphotyrosines of the IR play a major role in interacting
     with the SH2 domains of p85. In conclusion, both in vivo and in vitro data
     support a role for p85 in directly linking the IR to IRS-1 via its SH2
     domains. The formation of these complexes, therefore, may provide a
     mechanism for the translocation to the plasma membrane of
     phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and other molecules that are involved in IR
     signaling.

     substrate 1 expression and tyrosyl phosphorylation in human hepatocellular
     carcinoma cells.
PG  - 441-6
AB  - Ethanol inhibits insulin (IN) and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced
     hepatocyte DNA synthesis. Growth factor receptor kinases, such as IN and
     EGF, phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) and p36 protein
     kinase substrate, respectively, on tyrosine residues. IRS-1 and p36 are
     thought to be important intracellular signal transduction molecules
     involved in the regulation of cell growth. These investigations explored
     the effect of ethanol additions on the expression and tyrosyl
     phosphorylation (TP) of p36 and IRS-1 in a human hepatocellular carcinoma
     cell line (FOCUS) in relationship to cell proliferation induced by IN and
     serum growth factor stimulation. It was found that p36 was constitutively
     and highly expressed in serum-starved cells and protein, and mRNA levels
     did not change with cell proliferation induced by growth factors. However,
     exposure of FOCUS cells to ethanol additions substantially inhibited TP of
     p36. The early TP of IRS-1 induced by IN stimulation was also reduced by
     ethanol additions. Finally, there was a parallel decrease of FOCUS cell
     proliferation in ethanol-exposed cultures. These studies suggest that one
     possible mechanism of ethanol inhibitory effect on cell proliferation is
     through reduced TP of putative intracellular signal transduction
     molecules, such as p36 and IRS-1.

TI  - Insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the vav protooncogene
     product in cells of hematopoietic origin.
PG  - 7712-6
AB  - Insulin activates the ras signaling pathway and promotes hematopoietic
     cell proliferation. One possible mediator in such signaling is the vav
     proto-oncogene product (p95vav), which is specifically expressed in cells
     of hematopoietic origin and contains domains typical of guanine nucleotide
     exchange factors as well as Src homology 2 and Src homology 3 domains. We
     studied the tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav in hematopoietic cells
     expressing insulin receptors. Immunoblotting experiments with an
     antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody disclosed that insulin induces
     rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav in the human U-266
     myeloma cell line. These findings were confirmed by immunoprecipitation
     experiments performed with 32P-labeled cells and phosphoamino acid
     analysis of the bands corresponding to p95vav. Similarly,
     insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav was observed in the
     human IM-9 and mouse J558L hematopoietic cell lines. Furthermore, insulin
     treatment of cells led to the association of the Src homology 2 domain of
     p95vav with the activated beta-subunit of the insulin receptor in vitro.
     Altogether, these data suggest that p95vav is a substrate for the insulin
     receptor tyrosine kinase and may be involved in an insulin signaling
     pathway linking receptor-generated signals to Ras or other GTP-binding
     proteins in cells of hematopoietic origin.

PG  - 2558-62
AB  - The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor is a member of the
     transmembrane growth factor receptor protein family with intrinsic
     protein-tyrosine kinase activity. We describe a potent protein-tyrosine
     kinase inhibitor (CGP 53716) that shows selectivity for the PDGF receptor
     in vitro and in the cell. The compound shows selectivity for inhibition of
     PDGF-mediated events such as PDGF receptor autophosphorylation, cellular
     tyrosine phosphorylation, and c-fos mRNA induction in response to PDGF
     stimulation of intact cells. In contrast, ligand-induced
     autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, insulin
     receptor, and the insulin-like growth factor I receptor, as well as c-fos
     mRNA expression induced by EGF, fibroblast growth factor, and phorbol
     ester, was insensitive to inhibition by CGP 53716. In antiproliferative
     assays, the compound was approximately 30-fold more potent in inhibiting
     PDGF-mediated growth of v-sis-transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells relative to
     inhibition of EGF-dependent BALB/Mk cells, interleukin-3-dependent FDC-P1
     cells, and the T24 bladder carcinoma line. When tested in vivo using
     highly tumorigenic v-sis- and human c-sis-transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells,
     CGP 53716 showed antitumor activity at well-tolerated doses. In contrast,
     CGP 53716 did not show antitumor activity against xenografts of the A431
     tumor, which overexpresses the EGF receptor. These findings suggest that
     CGP 53716 may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of diseases
     involving abnormal cellular proliferation induced by PDGF receptor
     activation.

     insulin-like growth factor receptor), two putative receptor tyrosine
     kinases for which the ligand remains to be identified (the products of ryk
     and the mouse klg homolog), and a novel tyrosine kinase. We cloned cDNAs
     encoding both the murine and human homologs of this kinase, the sequences
     of which were subsequently published under the names sky (Ohashi, K.,
     Mizuno, K., Kuma, K., Miyata, T., and Nakamura, T. (1994) Oncogene 9,
     699-705) and rse (Mark, M. R., Scadden, D. T., Wang, Z., Gu, Q., Goddard,
     A., and Godowski, P. J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10720-10728). Mouse sky
     RNA levels are abundant in mammary tumors derived from transgenic mice
     that express wnt-1, fgf-3, or both oncogenes in their mammary glands.
     However, little or no expression of sky is detected in mammary glands from
     virgin animals or in preneoplastic mammary glands from wnt-1 transgenic
     mice. Moreover, we find that the human homolog of sky is expressed at
     elevated levels when normal human mammary epithelial cells are rendered
     tumorigenic by the introduction of two viral oncogenes. Transient
     transfection of the human SKY cDNA into the quail fibrosarcoma cell line
     QT6 reveals that SKY is an active tyrosine kinase that augments the level
     of cellular phosphotyrosine. Introduction of murine Sky into RatB1a
     fibroblasts by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer results in morphological
     transformation, growth in soft agar, and the formation of tumors in nude
     mice. These data raise the possibility that the Sky tyrosine kinase is
     involved in the development and/or progression of mammary tumors.

TI  - Activation of protein kinase C stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation and
     guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein association of p60 in rat
     hepatoma cells.
PG  - 476-81
AB  - In the present studies, insulin was found to stimulate in a rat hepatoma
     cell line (called FAO cells) the tyrosine phosphorylation of the
     60-kilodalton p21ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-associated protein
     called p60. Surprisingly, the tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein was
     also almost equally stimulated by an activator of protein kinase C (PKC),
     the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The tyrosine
     phosphorylation of p60 induced by either agent correlated with the
     formation of the GAP-p60 complex in situ and an increase in the ability of
     p60 to directly bind to the SH2 domain of GAP in vitro. Several lines of
     evidence indicated that the PMA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p60
     occurred through a different mechanism than that induced by insulin.
     First, the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of p60 by maximal
     concentrations of the two agents was almost additive. Second,
     down-regulation of PKC or pretreatment with a specific inhibitor of PKC
     abolished the ability of PMA to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of p60
     but had no effect on the insulin stimulation. And third, long-term
     pretreatment with insulin abolished the insulin response but did not
     affect the response to PMA. The PMA effect did seem to be mediated via a
     tyrosine kinase, since it was blocked by quercetin, an inhibitor of
     tyrosine kinases. These results indicate that both PMA and insulin can
     equally stimulate in FAO cells the tyrosine phosphorylation of p60 and its
     association with GAP, although these two agents seem to act via different
     signaling systems.

TI  - Tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase at sites in the
     catalytic domain regulates kinase activity: a role for Src family kinases.
PG  - 954-63
AB  - Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a widely expressed nonreceptor
     protein-tyrosine kinase implicated in integrin-mediated signal
     transduction pathways and in the process of oncogenic transformation by
     v-Src. Elevation of FAK's phosphotyrosine content, following both cell
     adhesion to extracellular matrix substrata and cell transformation by Rous
     sarcoma virus, correlates directly with an increased kinase activity. To
     help elucidate the role of FAK phosphorylation in signal transduction
     events, we used a tryptic phosphopeptide mapping approach to identify
     tyrosine sites of phosphorylation responsive to both cell adhesion and Src
     transformation. We have identified four tyrosines, 397, 407, 576, and 577,
     which are phosphorylated in mouse BALB/3T3 fibroblasts in an
     adhesion-dependent manner. Tyrosine 397 has been previously recognized as
     the major site of FAK autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of tyrosines
     407, 576, and 577, which are previously unrecognized sites, is
     significantly elevated in the presence of c-Src in vitro and v-Src in
     vivo. Tyrosines 576 and 577 lie within catalytic subdomain VIII--a region
     recognized as a target for phosphorylation-mediated regulation of protein
     kinase activity. We found that maximal kinase activity of FAK immune
     complexes requires phosphorylation of both tyrosines 576 and 577. Our
     results indicate that phosphorylation of FAK by Src (or other Src family
     kinases) is an important step in the formation of an active signaling
     complex.

TI  - Insulin-induced differentiation and modulation of neuronal thread protein
     expression in primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells is linked to
     phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1.
PG  - 91-108
AB  - Neuronal thread proteins (NTPs) are a family of developmentally regulated
     molecules expressed in central nervous system (CNS) neurons and primitive
     neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) cell lines. NTP gene expression is modulated
     with DNA synthesis, neuritic sprouting, and neuronal differentiation. The
     present study explores the mechanism of insulin modulation of NTP gene
     expression during neuronal differentiation using PNET cell lines of CNS
     origin. PNET2 cells underwent neuronal differentiation with neurite
     outgrowth coupled with transient up-regulation of several species of NTP.
     In contrast, PNET1 cells failed to differentiate in response to insulin
     stimulation, although insulin receptors were more abundant than in PNET2
     cells. Analysis of the insulin-mediated signal transduction pathway
     demonstrated that the lack of insulin responsiveness in PNET1 cells was
     primarily caused by impaired insulin-mediated tyrosyl phosphorylation of
     the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Correspondingly, the association
     between phosphatidyl-inositol 3 (PI3) kinase and phosphorylated IRS-1 was
     reduced in PNET1 compared with PNET2 cells. In contrast, the levels of
     IRS-1 protein were similar in PNET1 and PNET2 cells, and expression of the
     insulin receptor beta subunit (Ir beta) and insulin-mediated tyrosyl
     phosphorylation of the Ir beta were greater in PNET1 than PNET2 cells. The
     findings suggest that insulin effected neuronal differentiation and
     modulation of NTP gene expression in PNET cells utilizes a signal
     transduction cascade that requires tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1.

TI  - Modulatory effect of the transmembrane domain of the protein-tyrosine
     kinase encoded by oncogene ros: biological function and substrate
     interaction.
PG  - 10982-6
AB  - There is a 3-aa insertion in the transmembrane (TM) domain of the
     p68gag-ros protein-tyrosine kinase encoded by avian sarcoma virus UR2
     v-ros as compared with that of the protooncogene c-ros. The effect of this
     insertion on biological function and biochemical properties of v-Ros
     protein was investigated by deleting these 3 aa to generate the mutant
     TM1. This mutant has greatly reduced transforming, mitogenic, and
     tumorigenic activities despite the fact that the protein-tyrosine kinase
     activity and cell-surface localization of TM1 protein are unaffected.
     However, unlike UR2 protein, mutant TM1 protein becomes glycosylated, is
     differentially phosphorylated, and fails to induce tyrosine
     phosphorylation of a 88-kDa protein and a major substrate of insulin
     receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1. The TM1 protein is unable to
     associate with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and fails to promote
     association of insulin receptor substrate 1 with phosphatidylinositol
     3-kinase. By contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc protein and
     phospholipase C gamma as well as interaction of Grb2 protein with Shc and
     SOS protein signaling components are unaltered in the TM1 infected cells.
     Our results show that the TM-domain sequence of p68gag-ros profoundly
     affects its function and substrate interaction. The mutant defines a
     signaling pathway including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, insulin
     receptor substrate 1, and possibly an 88-kDa protein that does not overlap
     the Ras pathway and is important for full transforming and mitogenic
     potency of v-ros protein-tyrosine kinase.

TI  - Ethanol inhibits insulin-like growth factor-1-mediated signalling and
     proliferation of C6 rat glioblastoma cells.
PG  - 657-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy often results in
     disorders of fetal development (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome). The brain appears
     to be particularly vulnerable, and alcohol abuse during pregnancy is
     probably the most common cause of acquired mental retardation. We
     therefore studied the in vitro effects of ethanol on insulin-like growth
     factor-1 (IGF-1)-mediated proliferation of rat C6 glioblastoma cells.
     EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The proliferation of C6 rat glioblastoma cells was
     measured in serum-free medium supplemented with specific growth factors in
     the presence or absence of ethanol. The effect of ethanol on IGF-1
     receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation
     was determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, as was the
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase content within IRS-1 immunoprecipitates.
     RESULTS: C6 cells grew slowly in serum-free medium and proliferated in
     response to IGF-1. Ethanol, at physiologically tolerated concentrations,
     markedly inhibited the growth of C6 cells in response to IGF-1, but had no
     effect on the proliferative rate in the presence of platelet-derived
     growth factor or 1% fetal bovine serum. Inhibition of cell proliferation
     was evident when ethanol was only present during a 1-hour pulse of IGF-1.
     Cell growth in the presence of IGF-2 was also prevented by ethanol. The
     inhibition of IGF-1-mediated cell proliferation was accompanied by
     abrogation of IGF-1 receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation. Ethanol also
     interfered with the IGF-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and
     the association of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase with IRS-1. CONCLUSIONS:
     The data indicate that physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol
     inhibit the responses of glial cells to IGF-1, including IGF-1 receptor
     autophosphorylation, IRS-1 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activation,
     and cell growth.

AB  - Although the insulin-dependent hydrolysis of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol
     (GPI) may play an important role in insulin action, an absolute
     requirement for this glycolipid has not been demonstrated. Human K562
     cells were mutated to produce a cell line (IA) incapable of the earliest
     step in PI glycosylation, the formation of PI-GlcNAc. Another cell line
     (IVD) was deficient in the deacetylation of PI-GlcNAc to form PI-GlcN and
     subsequent mannosylated species. Each line was transfected with wild-type
     human insulin receptors. Similar insulin-stimulated receptor
     autophosphorylation was observed in all three lines, along with a nearly
     identical increase in the association of phosphorylated insulin receptor
     substrate 1 with endogenous PI 3-kinase. Both normal and GPI-defective
     lines also displayed a similar 2- to 3-fold increase in phosphorylation of
     the Shc protein and its association with growth factor receptor-bound
     protein 2 in response to insulin. In contrast to these results, striking
     differences were noted in insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. In normal
     cells, glycogen synthesis was significantly increased by insulin, whereas
     no insulin stimulation was observed in GPI-deficient IA cells, and only a
     trace of stimulation was detected in IVD cells. These results indicate
     that tyrosine phosphorylation produced by insulin is not dependent on GPI
     synthesis, and this effect is not sufficient to elicit at least some of
     the metabolic effects of the hormone. In contrast, GPI synthesis is
     required for the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin in these
     cells. These findings support the existence of divergent pathways in the
     action of insulin.

AB  - The ErbB3 protein is a member of the ErbB subfamily of receptor protein
     tyrosine kinases. In the present study, the mechanism by which the ErbB3
     protein is phosphorylated and the signal-transducing functions of this
     phosphorylated protein were investigated. When phosphorylated by the
     epidermal growth factor receptor in vitro, the ErbB3 protein strongly
     associated with the regulatory p85 subunit and the catalytic activity of
     phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. The association of PI 3-kinase with
     ErbB3 in human breast cancer cells was found to be correlated with the
     constitutive phosphorylation of ErbB3 on tyrosine residues. In MDA-MB-468
     breast cancer cells in which the ErbB3 protein is not constitutively
     phosphorylated, stimulation with epidermal growth factor led to the
     phosphorylation of ErbB3 on tyrosine residues and the formation of a
     functional signal transduction complex involving the ErbB3 protein and PI
     3-kinase. These results suggest that the ErbB3 protein can be
     phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by a cross-phosphorylation mechanism
     and that the phosphorylated ErbB3 protein can couple other growth factor
     receptor protein tyrosine kinases to the PI 3-kinase pathway in a manner
     similar to the insulin receptor substrate 1 protein.

TI  - Insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling are defective in the MDA
     MB-468 human breast cancer cell line.
PG  - 1077-83
AB  - Polypeptide growth factors including the insulin-like growth factors
     (IGFs), insulin, and transforming growth factor-alpha are mitogens for
     many breast cancer cell lines and may act as regulators of cancer cell
     growth. In a human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, which expresses IGF-I
     receptor (IGF-IR), stimulation with insulin or IGFs resulted in
     autophosphorylation of the IGF-IR in an increased proportion of ras bound
     to GTP and in the association of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)
     activity and of p85-PI3K with M(r) 185,000 phosphotyrosinylated proteins
     corresponding in size to insulin/IGF-IR substrates. These events were
     associated with enhanced proliferation. MDA MB-468 is a human breast
     cancer cell line which expresses insulin receptor and high levels of
     epidermal growth factor/transforming growth factor alpha receptor but low
     levels of IGF-IR. In this cell line, insulin stimulated
     autophosphorylation of IR at physiological concentrations and promoted the
     association of PI3K activity and of p85 with phosphotyrosine-containing
     proteins. Insulin did not, however, induce increased ras.GTP, and the
     cells exhibited minimal proliferation in response to insulin. Unlike
     insulin treatment, epidermal growth factor stimulation of MDA MB-468 cells
     is mitogenic and resulted in increased ras.GTP content, suggesting that
     the failure of insulin to induce these changes is not due to alterations
     in these signaling molecules. We conclude that there is a postreceptor
     defect in insulin signaling in MDA MB-468 which prevents the activation of
     ras and the induction of mitogenesis. Activation of PI3K by insulin is not
     sufficient to mediate mitogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

     cells decreases insulin receptor function and expression through protein
     kinase C-dependent and independent pathways]
PG  - 882-5
AB  - In view of the potent mitogenic effect exerted by insulin in human colonic
     cells, we used Caco-2 cells transfected with an activated (Val12) human
     Ha-ras gene or the polyoma middle T (PyMT) oncogene, a constitutive
     activator of pp60c-src tyrosine kinase activity, to investigate the effect
     of oncogenic p21ras and PyMT/pp60c-src on insulin mitogenic signaling. As
     compared to vector control Caco-2 cells, both oncogene-transfected cells
     exhibited: 1) a lost of response to insulin's stimulatory effect on
     mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity and cell proliferation,
     both of which were constitutively increased; 2) a decrease in insulin
     receptor (IR) affinity and insulin-stimulated exogenous tyrosine kinase
     activity, which resulted, at least in part, from increased protein kinase
     C (PKC) activity (4), since both IR alterations were partially corrected
     by PKC down-regulation; and 3) a decrease in both insulin receptor mRNA
     level and insulin receptor number, which was independent of PKC since it
     persisted after PKC down-regulation. In conclusion, oncogenic p21ras and
     PyMT/pp60c-src abolished insulin mitogenic signaling in Caco-2 cells
     through mechanisms involving (i) constitutive activation of MAP kinase,
     and (ii) marked decreases in both insulin receptor function and expression
     which were mediated by PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways
     respectively. This is the first evidence that, when oncogenically
     activated, p21ras and pp60c-src not only exert a negative control on
     insulin receptor function but also repress insulin receptor gene
     expression in human colonic cells.

TI  - Reduced tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor in
     obesity-diabetes. Central role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
PG  - 1543-9
AB  - Insulin resistance is an important metabolic abnormality often associated
     with infections, cancer, obesity, and especially non-insulin-dependent
     diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). We have previously demonstrated that tumor
     necrosis factor-alpha produced by adipose tissue is a key mediator of
     insulin resistance in animal models of obesity-diabetes. However, the
     mechanism by which TNF-alpha interferes with insulin action is not known.
     Since a defective insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase activity has been
     observed in obesity and NIDDM, we measured the IR tyrosine kinase activity
     in the Zucker (fa/fa) rat model of obesity and insulin resistance after
     neutralizing TNF-alpha with a soluble TNF receptor (TNFR)-lgG fusion
     protein. This neutralization resulted in a marked increase in
     insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the IR, as well as
     phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) in muscle and fat
     tissues of the fa/fa rats, restoring them to near control (lean) levels.
     In contrast, no significant changes were observed in insulin-stimulated
     tyrosine phosphorylations of IR and IRS-1 in liver. The physiological
     significance of the improvements in IR signaling was indicated by a
     concurrent reduction in plasma glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid
     levels. These results demonstrate that TNF-alpha participates in
     obesity-related systemic insulin resistance by inhibiting the IR tyrosine
     kinase in the two tissues mainly responsible for insulin-stimulated
     glucose uptake: muscle and fat.

AB  - To investigate the expression and subcellular distribution of insulin
     receptor substrate-1 in hepatocytes, which are major targets of insulin
     along with muscle and adipose tissue, we obtained monoclonal antibodies by
     immunizing mice with a fusion protein consisting of the C-terminal portion
     of the human insulin receptor substrate-1 and glutathione-S-transferase.
     Two of the monoclonal antibodies (designated as 7B3 and 6G5) were found to
     be useful for immunohistochemical studies. Using 6G5 we demonstrate a high
     level of expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 in liver cirrhosis
     hepatocytes and variable expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
     These results suggest that insulin receptor substrate-1 may play a role in
     liver regeneration during cirrhosis and that an insulin signaling cascade
     may be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis.

TI  - PC12 cells overexpressing the insulin receptor undergo insulin-dependent
     neuronal differentiation.
PG  - 702-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stimulation of phaeochromocytoma PC12 cells by nerve growth
     factor leads to growth arrest and neuronal differentiation, whereas
     insulin induces various metabolic responses such as metabolism of glucose
     and lipids. Moreover, both insulin and epidermal growth factor stimulate
     the proliferation of PC12 cells. In spite of their different biological
     effects, nerve growth factor, insulin and epidermal growth factor induce
     very similar early responses in PC12 cells. Stimulation with nerve growth
     factor leads to the sustained activation and nuclear translocation of
     mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. By contrast, both insulin and
     epidermal growth factor induce the transient activation of MAP kinase,
     without pronounced nuclear translocation of the enzyme. We have
     investigated whether the differential activation of signaling pathway
     components can account for the distinct cellular responses to these
     different growth factors. RESULTS: By overexpressing insulin receptors in
     PC12 cells, we observed insulin-dependent neurite outgrowth, similar to
     that induced by nerve growth factor in both non-transfected and
     overexpressing cells. Overexpression of insulin receptors in PC12 cells
     leads to a more pronounced, but similar pattern of insulin-induced
     tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in PC12 cells, including enhanced
     recruitment of Grb2/Sos into a complex with either Shc or IRS1. MAP kinase
     activation in response to insulin stimulation of cells overexpressing the
     insulin receptor is similar to MAP kinase activation in response to NGF
     stimulation of parental or overexpressing PC12 cells: the activation is
     prolonged and nuclear translocation of the enzyme occurs. CONCLUSION: The
     differential subcellular localization and duration of MAP kinase
     activation induced by insulin and NGF may explain the difference in the
     biological actions of these two factors on PC12 cells. Our results show
     that the strength of the signal generated by a receptor with tyrosine
     kinase activity can influence the downstream signaling pathway, leading to
     cell differentiation instead of cell proliferation.

     cells by ras and polyoma middle T oncogenes.
PG  - 18686-93
AB  - Taking advantage of the potent mitogenic effect exerted by insulin in
     human colonic cells, we used Caco-2 cells transfected with an activated
     (Val-12) human Haras gene or the polyoma middle T (PyMT) oncogene, a
     constitutive activator of pp60c-src tyrosine kinase activity, to
     investigate the effect of oncogenic p21ras and PyMT/pp60c-src on insulin
     mitogenic signaling. As compared to vector control Caco-2 cells, both
     oncogene-transfected cells exhibited: 1) a loss of response to insulin's
     stimulatory effect on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity and
     cell proliferation, both of which were constitutively increased; 2) a
     decrease in insulin receptor (IR) affinity and insulin-stimulated
     exogenous tyrosine kinase activity, which resulted from increased protein
     kinase C (PKC) activity (Delage, S., Chastre, E., Empereur, S., Wicek, D.,
     Veissiere, D., Capeau, J., Gespach, C., and Cherqui, G. (1993) Cancer Res.
     53, 2762-2770), since IR alterations were corrected by PKC
     down-regulation; and 3) a decrease in both IR mRNA level and IR number,
     which was independent of PKC since it persisted after PKC down-regulation.
     In conclusion, this is the first evidence that oncogenic p21ras and
     PyMT/pp60c-src abolish insulin mitogenic signaling in human colonic cells
     through mechanisms involving (i) constitutive activation of MAP kinase and
     (ii) marked decreases in both IR function and expression which are
     mediated by PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways, respectively.

TI  - Proximal enhancer of the human insulin receptor gene binds the
     transcription factor Sp1.
PG  - 884-9
AB  - The insulin receptor is a growth regulator present on the surface of most
     cells that transmits a mitogenic signal in response to insulin. Thus, the
     gene for the insulin receptor is constitutively expressed at low levels in
     all cells. We characterize a constitutive enhancer element that is present
     in the proximal promoter of the human insulin receptor gene. We have
     localized the enhancer to a 26-base-pair (26-bp) sequence from -528 to
     -503. When this sequence is inserted into the proximal promoter, a three-
     to fourfold increase in promoter activity is observed, and when two copies
     are inserted, a five- to sixfold increase is seen. Electrophoretic
     mobility shift analysis demonstrates that nuclear factors binding to this
     sequence are found in many different cell types. At least two proteins
     with different specificities bind within this 26-bp sequence. The identity
     of the predominant binding protein is Sp1, because an oligonucleotide
     composed of an Sp1 consensus binding sequence can compete for several of
     the DNA-protein complexes. In addition, we demonstrate that purified Sp1
     can bind to the 26-bp oligonucleotide and that this complex comigrates
     with a DNA-protein complex formed with a HeLa nuclear extract. Finally, an
     antibody to human Sp1 protein is able to bind to the enhancer DNA/HeLa
     protein complex and supershift this complex. These findings suggest that
     this sequence corresponds to a general element that may contribute to the
     ubiquitous expression of the human insulin receptor gene.

TI  - Functional insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors are
     preferentially expressed in multiple myeloma cell lines as compared to
     B-lymphoblastoid cell lines.
PG  - 3179-85
AB  - While IGF-1 plays a role in early B-cell development, little is known of
     insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) action in post-marrow
     B-cells. Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that mouse and human
     multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines possess functional insulin receptors
     (IRs) and IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1Rs). In this study, we show that
     responsiveness to insulin and IGF-1 is more developed in human MM cell
     lines than in human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. Two human MM cell lines
     (U266 and RPMI 8226) were compared to three B-lymphoblastoid cell lines
     [Epstein-Barr virus immortalized B-cells (EBV), a Burkitt lymphoma cell
     line (Ramos), and a non-EBV lymphoblastoid cell line (HS Sultan)]. Surface
     IR and IGF-1R expression, measured by flow cytometry, demonstrated that
     the MM cell lines expressed more IRs and IGF-1Rs than did the EBV, Ramos,
     or HS Sultan cell lines. In vitro receptor kinase activity of
     affinity-purified receptors showed that the MM cells had more
     phosphorylated receptors than did the EBV, Ramos, or HS Sultan cells.
     Intracellular receptor signaling was also markedly different between the
     two cell groups. Whole cell phosphorylation studies showed that MM cells
     possessed not only hormone-dependent receptor autophosphorylation (M(r)
     97,000) but also substrate phosphorylation (M(r) 185,000; 60,000). The
     lymphoblastoid cells, while demonstrating receptor autophosphorylation (IR
     autophosphorylation in the EBV cell line at 200 nM hormone was similar to
     MM receptor phosphorylation at 2 nM), lacked hormone-responsive
     substrates. The MM cell lines contained significantly more
     hormone-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity
     than the B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. In the MM cells, PI 3-kinase was
     activated by at least 10-fold, but, in the B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, it
     was activated by no more than 2-fold. Hormone-responsive glucose
     metabolism was also greater in the MM cell lines. In the U266 cells,
     insulin increased lactate production 62 +/- 9 and 101 +/- 12% (mean +/-
     SE) at concentrations of 2 nM and 200 nM, respectively. IGF-1 produced 72
     +/- 9 and 99 +/- 13% increases at similar concentrations. In the 8226
     cells, insulin increased lactate production 4 +/- 4 and 36 +/- 15% at 2
     and 200 nM, respectively. IGF-1 produced a 13 +/- 6 and 70 +/- 18%
     increase. In the EBV and Ramos cells, neither hormone increased lactate
     production by more than 10 +/- 3%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

     induced by culture with insulin, in a novel SV40-DNA-immortalized
     hepatocyte cell line (P9 cells).
PG  - 835-42
AB  - An immortalized cell line, called P9, was derived from hepatocytes by
     transfection with SV40 DNA. These cells expressed enzyme activities
     characteristic of hepatocytes, namely glucose-6-phosphatase, glycogen
     phosphorylase, bilirubin glucuronyltransferase and both glucagon- and
     prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities, albeit at
     decreased levels compared with native hepatocytes. Levels of the G-protein
     subunits alpha-Gi-2, alpha-Gi-3, G beta and the 'long' form of alpha-G2
     (45 kDa) were approximately 4-fold higher relative to native hepatocytes,
     whereas those of the 'short' form of alpha-G2 (42 kDa) were lower by
     approximately 40%. Associated with this were marked alterations in the
     guanine nucleotide regulation of adenylate cyclase. Receptor-mediated
     stimulation, achieved by either PGE1 or glucagon, was apparent in P9
     cells, although the latter was only evident upon amplification with
     forskolin. Glucagon-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in P9 cells did not
     exhibit desensitization, as in hepatocytes, nor was the phosphorylation of
     alpha-Gi-2 evident. Culture of P9 cells with insulin led to a
     dose-dependent decrease (EC50 0.2 +/- 0.1 nM) in the ability of PGE1 to
     stimulate adenylate cyclase activity, with the maximum effect attained
     after approximately 6 h. A comparable attenuation of stimulation was seen
     for glucagon- and guanine-nucleotide-stimulated adenylate cyclase
     activities. In cells cultured with insulin, lower levels of GTP were
     required to stimulate adenylate cyclase, ADP-ribosylation of the 45 kDa
     form of alpha-Gs with cholera toxin was attenuated, and the expression of
     both alpha Gi-2 and alpha-Gi-3 was increased. It is suggested that the
     expression of alpha-Gi-2 and alpha-Gi-3 may be directly regulated by the
     action of insulin in hepatocytes and P9 cells.

     sensitivity to insulin, insulin growth factor-I, and platelet-derived
     growth factor-AA.
PG  - 551-60
AB  - The role of intracellular pH (pHin) in the regulation of cell growth in
     both normal and transformed cells is a topic of considerable controversy.
     In an effort to study this relationship NIH 3T3 cells were stably
     transfected with the gene for the yeast H(+)-ATPase, constitutively
     elevating their pHin. The resulting cell line, RN1a, has a transformed
     phenotype: The cells are serum independent for growth, clone in soft agar,
     and form tumors in nude mice. In the present study, we further
     characterize this system in order to understand how transfection with this
     proton pump leads to serum-independent growth, using defined media to
     investigate the effects of specific growth factors on the transfected and
     parental NIH 3T3 cells. While both cell lines show similar growth
     increases in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and
     epidermal growth factor (EGF), they respond differently to insulin,
     insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and PDGF-AA. RN1a cells exhibit
     increased growth at nanomolar concentrations of insulin but the parental
     cells had only a relatively minor response to insulin at 10 microM. Both
     cell lines showed some response to IGF-I in the nanomolar range but the
     response of RN1a cells was much larger. Differences in insulin and IGF-I
     receptor number alone could not explain these results. The two cell lines
     also respond differently to PDGF-AA. RN1a cells are relatively insensitive
     to stimulation by PDGF-AA and express fewer PDGF alpha receptors as shown
     by Northern blots and receptor-binding studies. We propose a unifying
     hypothesis in which the H(+)-ATPase activates a downstream element in the
     PDGF-AA signal transduction pathway that complements insulin and IGF-I
     signals, while leading to downregulation of the PDGF alpha receptor.

PG  - 4854-8
AB  - Insulin resistance is a common problem associated with infections and
     cancer and, most importantly, is the central component of
     non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We have recently shown that tumor
     necrosis factor (TNF) alpha is a key mediator of insulin resistance in
     animal models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Here, we
     investigate how TNF-alpha interferes with insulin action. Chronic exposure
     of adipocytes to low concentrations of TNF-alpha strongly inhibits
     insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Concurrently, TNF-alpha treatment
     causes a moderate decrease in the insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation
     of the insulin receptor (IR) and a dramatic decrease in the
     phosphorylation of IR substrate 1, the major substrate of the IR in vivo.
     The IR isolated from TNF-alpha-treated cells is also defective in the
     ability to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate IR substrate 1 in vitro.
     These results show that TNF-alpha directly interferes with the signaling
     of insulin through its receptor and consequently blocks biological actions
     of insulin.

TI  - T-cell antigen CD28 interacts with the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol
     3-kinase by a cytoplasmic Tyr(P)-Met-Xaa-Met motif.
PG  - 2834-8
AB  - The T-cell antigen CD28 provides a costimulatory signal that is required
     for T-cell proliferation. T-cell receptor zeta/CD3 engagement without CD28
     ligation leads to a state of nonresponsiveness/anergy, thereby implicating
     CD28 in the control of peripheral tolerance to foreign antigens or tumors.
     A key unresolved question has concerned the mechanism by which CD28
     generates intracellular signals. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI
     3-kinase) is a lipid kinase with Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain(s) that binds
     to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), an interaction
     that is essential for signaling by growth factor. In this study, we
     demonstrate that CD28 binds to PI 3-kinase by means of a Y(P)MXM motif
     within its cytoplasmic tail. CD28-associated PI 3-kinase was detected by
     lipid kinase and HPLC analysis as well as by reconstitution experiments
     with baculoviral-expressed p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. CD28 bound directly
     to the p85 subunit without the need for the associated p110 subunit.
     Site-directed mutagenesis and peptide competition analysis using
     Y(P)-MXM-containing peptides showed that PI 3-kinase bound to a Y(P)MXM
     motif within the CD28 cytoplasmic tail (residues 191-194). Mutation of the
     Y191 within the motif resulted in a complete loss of binding, while
     mutation of M194 caused partial loss of binding. Binding analysis showed
     that the CD28 Y(P)-MXM motif bound to the p85 C- and N-terminal SH2
     domains with an affinity comparable to that observed for PDGF-R and
     insulin receptor substrate 1. In terms of signaling, CD28 ligation induced
     a dramatic increase in the recruitment and association of PI 3-kinase with
     the receptor. CD28 is likely to use PI 3-kinase as the second signal
     leading to T-cell proliferation, an event with implications for anergy and
     peripheral T-cell tolerance.

PG  - 1281-4
AB  - The 2;5 chromosomal translocation occurs in most anaplastic large-cell
     non-Hodgkin's lymphomas arising from activated T lymphocytes. This
     rearrangement was shown to fuse the NPM nucleolar phosphoprotein gene on
     chromosome 5q35 to a previously unidentified protein tyrosine kinase gene,
     ALK, on chromosome 2p23. In the predicted hybrid protein, the amino
     terminus of nucleophosmin (NPM) is linked to the catalytic domain of
     anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Expressed in the small intestine,
     testis, and brain but not in normal lymphoid cells, ALK shows greatest
     sequence similarity to the insulin receptor subfamily of kinases.
     Unscheduled expression of the truncated ALK may contribute to malignant
     transformation in these lymphomas.

TI  - Differentiational regulation and phosphorylation of the fatty acid-binding
     protein from rat mammary epithelial cells.
PG  - 189-97
AB  - From the soluble protein fraction of lactating rat mammary epithelial
     cells, fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) was isolated by immunoaffinity
     chromatography. After digestion with trypsin, peptides were characterized
     with time-of-flight mass spectrometry and revealed identity with
     corresponding peptides derived from the heart-type FABP isolated from rat
     heart. In addition, by electrospray mass spectrometry the molecular mass
     has been determined to 14683.9 +/- 3 Da, further corroborating the
     identity. The content of FABP in mammary glands from virgin, pregnant and
     lactating rats was evaluated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and
     a FABP-specific immunosorbent assay. In the two-dimensional gels FABP was
     the apparently most abundant cytosolic protein in mammary epithelial cells
     from rats in late pregnancy as well as from lactating rats. The content of
     FABP was 59 +/- 19 microgram/mg (n = 11) of soluble proteins from the
     fully differentiated lactating mammary gland as determined by ELISA. This
     value represented an 80-fold increase compared with the FABP content of
     mammary gland from virgin rats, and is comparable with the level found in
     rat heart. Upon stimulation with insulin a small fraction of FABP was
     phosphorylated in lactating mammary epithelial cells. In conclusion, these
     findings indicate that the FABPs from rat mammary gland and heart are
     identical and further suggest that in mammary gland this FABP may play a
     role in signal transduction downstream from the insulin receptor.

TI  - Deletion of residues 485-599 from the human insulin receptor abolishes
     antireceptor antibody binding and influences tyrosine kinase activation.
PG  - 315-24
AB  - We have studied insulin and antireceptor antibody binding to mutated human
     insulin receptors deleted of residues 485-599 in the alpha-subunit by
     site-directed mutagenesis. Both normal and mutated receptors were
     expressed in rat HTC hepatoma cells. Cells expressing either the normal
     receptor or the mutated receptor retained the ability to bind insulin. In
     contrast to the normal receptor, however, the mutated receptor failed to
     interact with antireceptor alpha-subunit antibodies. The inability of the
     mutated receptor to interact with various antireceptor antibodies was
     further documented by photoaffinity labeling studies. In intact HTC cells
     expressing mutated receptors, basal insulin receptor tyrosine
     autophosphorylation was 2-fold elevated when compared to cells expressing
     normal receptors. In these cells, however, the response of this function
     to insulin was blunted. When receptors were isolated from these cells and
     assayed for both autophosphorylation and phosphotransferase activities
     toward the synthetic substrate poly(Glu, Tyr), the response to insulin was
     also blunted. To study the ability of the mutated receptor to
     transmembrane signal, insulin stimulation of S6 kinase activity was
     measured. In cells with mutated receptors, in concert with the insulin
     receptor kinase data, basal S6 kinase activity was elevated, and the
     response to insulin was blunted. The data suggest, therefore, that
     residues 485-599 in the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor are critical
     for antireceptor antibody binding, but not for insulin binding. Moreover,
     these data suggest that residues 485-599 contain a regulatory domain for
     insulin regulation of receptor beta-subunit functions.
