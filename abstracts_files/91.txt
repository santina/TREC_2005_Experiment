TI  - Phage display of functional human TNF-alpha converting enzyme catalytic
     domain: a rapid method for the production of stabilized proteolytic
     proteins for assay development and high-throughput screening.
PG  - 433-40
AB  - The catalytic domain of human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)
     converting enzyme (TACE) was expressed in a phage display system to
     determine whether stable and active enzyme could be made for
     high-throughput screening (HTS). This would address many issues around
     screening of proteases in this class. The phage-displayed TACE catalytic
     domain (PDT) properly cleaved the fusion protein of glutathione
     S-transferase (GST)-pro-TNF-alpha to generate the mature TNF-alpha in
     vitro. To determine the utility of the PDT in HTS, the authors further
     demonstrated that PDT was able to generate a strong reproducible
     fluorescence signal by cleaving a fluorogenic TNF-alpha-specific peptide
     in vitro. More important, the catalytic activity of the PDT was inhibited
     by a broad-spectrum matrix metalloprotease (MMP) inhibitor but not by an
     MMP-I specific inhibitor, illustrating the potential utility of PDT for
     HTS. The PDT was also compared with baculovirus-expressed TACE (BET) in
     these assays to establish the relative efficacy of PDT. Both PDT and BET
     showed a similar specific cleavage profile against the defined substrates.
     Activity of the BET, however, was stable at 4 degrees C for less than 24
     h. In contrast, the PDT exhibited remarkable stability, losing very little
     activity even after 2 years at 4 degrees C. On the basis of these results,
     the authors concluded that the phage display system might be a useful tool
     for expressing proteins that have stability issues related to
     auto-proteolytic activity. Furthermore, the ease and low cost of
     large-scale production of phage should make it suitable for assay
     development and HTS.

TI  - Drosophila S3 ribosomal protein accelerates repair of 8-oxoguanine
     performed by human and mouse cell extracts.
PG  - 50-8
AB  - The S3 ribosomal protein of Drosophila melanogaster possesses various DNA
     repair activities, including the capacity to incise at
     apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG)
     residues. We have recently hypothesized that this multifunctional protein
     may improve the efficiency of DNA base excision repair (BER) in mammalian
     cells. We have investigated the effect of pure GST-tagged Drosophila S3 on
     BER of different endogenous lesions performed by human and mouse cell
     extracts. Drosophila S3 significantly accelerated the BER of 8-oxoG
     (initiated by the bifunctional glycosylase OGG1). The stimulating effect
     was linked to the capacity of S3 to remove the 8-oxoG lesion and cleave
     the resulting AP site, rather than acceleration of downstream steps of the
     BER pathway (e.g., removal of 3' blocking fragments). No stimulating
     effect was observed on the BER of uracil, natural AP sites, and
     beta-lyase-cleaved AP sites. Heterologous expression of Drosophila S3 may
     be used to enhance 8-oxoG repair in human cells.

PG  - 243-51
AB  - A 1.1 bp fragment of E2 gene of Chinese classical swine fever virus(CSFV)
     Shimen strain, a standard virulent strain, was amplified by RT-PCR from
     total RNA of cell cultures infected by CSFV, and cloned into pGEM T
     vector. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment was sequenced by Sanger's
     method and the amino acid sequence was deduced. Compared with the
     corresponding region of Alfort, Brescia and C strain of CSFV, the
     nucleotide sequence homology is 84.7%, 92.6% and 95.2% respectively, and
     the amino acid sequence 89.4%, 92.6% and 94.6%, respectively, we subcloned
     1.1 bp of E2 gene cDNA into baculovirus transfer vector and successfully
     constructed two recombinant baculoviruses expressing GST-E2 and GST-GFP-E2
     fusion protein respectively by homologous recombination in sf-9 cell.
     Furthermore, we also constructed recombinant eukaryotic expression vector
     pcE2 containing E2 gene in frame and transfected COS-7 cell by
     lipofectamine, the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) showed that the
     expressed E2 protein can be recognized by E2 specific monoclonal antibody
     the pcE2 DNA was directly injected into BALB/c mice intramuscular(i.m.)
     and the CSFV E2-specific antibodies was measured by enzyme-linked
     immunosorbent assay(ELISA) the ELISA results indicated the E2-specific
     antibodies was induced in inoculated mice and virus neutralization assays
     also indicate single inoculations of plasmids expressing CSFV E2
     glycoprotein raised neutralizing antibody in BALB/c mice. these results
     will be beneficial to investigate the possibility of DNA vaccine against
     CSFV.

TI  - Interaction of casein kinase II with ribosomal protein L22 of Drosophila
     melanogaster.
PG  - 60-6
AB  - The ubiquitous eukaryotic protein kinase CKII (casein kinase II) has been
     found to interact with a number of cellular proteins, either through the
     catalytic subunit or the regulatory subunit. Using the yeast two-hybrid
     screening method, we found that the catalytic subunit of Drosophila
     melanogaster CKII (DmCKII) interacts with Drosophila ribosomal protein L22
     (rpL22). This interaction was also observed in vitro with a
     glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-rpL22 fusion protein. The predicted
     full-length Drosophila rpL22 protein has an N-terminal extension rich in
     alanine, lysine, and proline that appears to be unique to Drosophila.
     Deletion mapping revealed that the conserved core of rpL22 is responsible
     for the interaction with CKII. Moreover, purified DmCKII can phosphorylate
     a GST-L22 fusion protein at the C-terminal end, suggesting that this
     protein may be a substrate of CKII in Drosophila.

AB  - Temporal expression profile of lef4, the gene encoding late gene
     expression factor 4 (LEF4) from the baculovirus, Bombyx mori
     nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), has been analysed. lef4 behaved like an
     early gene and the transcripts were detectable from 6 h post infection
     (hpi) which reached maximal levels by 18-24 hpi, and declined considerably
     at later times. The LEF4 open reading frame was bacterially expressed as a
     glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein which was solubilized from
     the inclusion bodies and purified by adsorption to the affinity matrix,
     GST-Sepharose. Using polyclonal antibodies raised against the bacterially
     expressed protein, the temporal profile of LEF4 synthesis in
     BmNPV-infected BmN cells was analysed. The LEF4 protein levels were also
     higher at 24 hpi compared to 12 or 36 hpi, correlating with the RNA
     patterns. The protein was predominantly localized to the nucleus of the
     infected BmN cell and only a small portion was present in the cytosolic
     fraction. Preliminary studies with antisense lef4 expression revealed
     substantial reduction in expression from the viral polyhedrin promoter
     without significantly affecting the viral DNA replication.

PG  - 23-35
AB  - The biochemical and biophysical characteristics of Janus protein-tyrosine
     kinases (JAKs), which are essential early mediators of cytokine-initiated
     signal propagation, are virtually undefined. To facilitate the in vitro
     analysis of JAK-mediated catalysis, we substantially purified a soluble
     recombinant JAK2 and developed a novel means of quantifying JAK-catalyzed
     product formation. Glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins containing
     active and inactive forms of rat Janus kinase 2 (GST:rJAK2 and
     GST:rJAK2(CA795)) were highly purified via affinity chromatography. A
     microtiterplate-based ELISA was used to measure tyrosine phosphorylation
     of a streptavidin-immobilized biotinylated STAT1-derived peptide. The
     ELISA data indicated that only about 1% of the enzyme was involved in
     exogenous substrate phosphorylation. Other immobilized peptides served as
     apparent substrates with varying efficacy. Traditional radioisotopic
     autokinase assays demonstrated that the activity of the purified fusion
     protein was inhibited by a variety of tyrphostin inhibitors.
     Non-radiolabeled adenine nucleotides, but not guanine nucleotides,
     inhibited the radioisotopic autokinase assay. These observations verify
     that the catalytic activity of JAK2 is highly regulated, and are
     consistent with the suggestion that JAK2 may require additional accessory
     proteins, such as a potential upstream regulatory kinase, for full
     catalytic activity.

TI  - A approximately 35 kDa polypeptide from insect cells binds to yeast ACS
     like elements in the presence of ATP.
PG  - 23
AB  - BACKGROUND: The S. cerevisiae origin recognition complex binds to the ARS
     consensus sequence in an ATP dependent fashion. Recently, the yeast Cdc6
     has been reported to have DNA binding activity. Conservation of
     replication proteins among different species strongly supports their
     functional similarity. Here we report the results of an investigation into
     the DNA binding activity of human Cdc6 protein. Cdc6 was expressed and
     purified from baculovirus infected Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) insect
     cells as GST fusion protein (GST-Cdc6) and its DNA binding activity was
     tested. RESULTS: Partially purified fractions containing GSTCdc6 or GST
     showed an ACS binding activity in an ATP dependent manner. However,
     further purification revealed the presence of a putative 35 kDa insect
     cell protein (p35) which was found responsible for the DNA binding
     activity. A close match to the 9/11 bases of the ARS consensus sequence
     was sufficient for p35 binding activity. A DNA fragment from the human
     c-myc origin region containing yeast ACS like elements also showed p35
     binding activity. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a Spodoptera frugiperda
     protein with ATP dependent DNA binding activity to ACS like elements. ACS
     like elements have been reported to be essential for ORC binding and
     replication initiation in yeast but their role in higher eukaryotes still
     remains elusive. Like the ARS consensus sequence elements of yeast, ACS
     like elements found in c-myc and lamin beta 2 origin regions may play
     similar roles in replication and indicate a conserved role for this DNA
     motif among eukaryotes.

     sporozoites was cloned by PCR from the synthesized first strand cDNA. It

     Strain LS18. The gene was expressed through standard procedures in the
     modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV-OCC(-))
     expression system and large amount of heterologous fusion protein
     (GST-6xHis-Etp28) was obtained. The expression product was about 21.3% of
     the total cellular protein of an infected cell and corresponding to
     approximately 0.42 mg of recombinant protein per 10(6) cells. And the
     immunoprotective trial showed that this candidate for recombinant vaccine
     conferred partial protection against chicken coccidiosis.

TI  - The ubiquitin-interacting motifs target the endocytic adaptor protein
     epsin for ubiquitination.
PG  - 1112-6
AB  - The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to proteins is an evolutionarily
     conserved signal for rapid protein degradation. However, additional
     cellular functions for ubiquitination are now emerging, including
     regulation of protein trafficking and endocytosis. For example, recent
     genetic studies suggested a role for ubiquitination in regulating epsin, a
     modular endocytic adaptor protein that functions in the assembly of
     clathrin-coated vesicles; however, biochemical evidence for this notion
     has been lacking. Epsin consists of an epsin NH(2)-terminal homology
     (ENTH) domain that promotes the interaction with phospholipids, several
     AP2 binding sites, two clathrin binding sequences, and several Eps15
     homology (EH) domain binding motifs. Interestingly, epsin also possesses
     several recently described ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that have
     been postulated to bind ubiquitin. Here, we demonstrate that epsin is
     predominantly monoubiquitinated and resistant to proteasomal degradation.
     The UIMs are necessary for epsin ubiquitination but are not the site of
     ubiquitination. Finally, we demonstrate that the isolated UIMs from both
     epsin and an unrelated monoubiquitinated protein, Eps15, are sufficient to
     promote ubiquitination of a chimeric glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-UIM
     fusion protein. Thus, our data suggest that UIMs may serve as a general
     signal for ubiquitination.

     ni, Tn-IAP1v, a variant of lepidopteran Tn-IAP1, was cloned by RT-PCR.
     There are six single nucleotide polymorphisms between the two Tn-IAP1
     variants, resulting in three predicted single amino acid polymorphisms.
     With the GST fusion expression system, soluble recombinant Tn-IAP1v was
     highly expressed in Escherichia coli and then purified by affinity
     chromatography. Caspase inhibition assays indicated that recombinant
     Tn-IAP1v could specifically inhibit human caspase-9 in vitro instead of
     caspase-3, -7, and -8, which was further confirmed by the observation that
     recombinant Tn-IAP1v can directly bind caspase-9 in the protein pull-down
     assay. These results suggested that Tn-IAP1v might serve as an initiator
     caspase inhibitor in vivo in the conserved mitochondria apoptotic pathway.

AB  - The non-structural protein 5b (NS5b) of hepatitis C virus (HCV), bearing
     an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, is considered as a new
     target of antiviral therapy. We expressed and purified the C-terminal 21
     amino acid truncated NS5b protein fused with glutathione S-transferase
     (GST-5bC21) using Escherichia coli. With the highly purified GST-5bC21
     protein, we established an in vitro assay system for RdRp activity by
     using poly(C) as the template and a 12 mer oligo(rG) as the primer. The
     optimal conditions for testing various concentrations of template, primer
     and proteins were determined to 22 degrees C and a pH of 7.5. The addition
     of 2.5 mM Mn(2+) increased the activity profoundly, to a level fivefold
     higher than that in the presence of 10 mM Mg(2+). At higher concentrations
     of Mn(2+), GST-5bC21 is stable as compared with previously reported
     full-length NS5b expressed using insect cells or NS5b protein with the
     C-terminal 18 amino acids deleted. This sensitive and easy to use
     quantitative assay system will provide a stable system for the screening
     of inhibitors for HCV RdRp.

     S-transferase from Anopheles dirus.
PG  - 425-33
AB  - A new Anopheles dirus glutathione S-transferase (GST) has been obtained
     and named adGST4-1. Both genomic DNA and cDNA for heterologous expression
     were acquired. The genomic sequence was 3188bp and consisted of the GST
     gene as well as flanking sequence. The flanking sequence was analyzed for
     possible regulatory elements that would control gene expression. In
     Drosophila several of these elements have been shown to be involved in
     development and cell differentiation. The deduced amino acid sequence has
     low identity compared with the four alternatively spliced enzymes,
     adGST1-1 to 1-4, from another An. dirus GST gene adgst1AS1. The percent
     identities are 30--40% and 11--12% comparing adGST4-1 to insect GSTs from
     Delta and Sigma classes, respectively. Enzyme characterization of adGST4-1
     shows it to be distinct from the other An. dirus GSTs because of low
     enzyme activity for customary GST substrates including 1-chloro-2,
     4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). However, this enzyme has a greater affinity of
     interaction with pyrethroids compared to the other An. dirus GSTs.

TI  - The endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie1 activates
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt to inhibit apoptosis.
PG  - 1704-13
AB  - Tie1 is an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed almost
     exclusively in endothelial cells and that is required for normal embryonic
     vascular development. Genetic studies suggest that Tie1 promotes
     endothelial cell survival, but other studies have suggested that the Tie1
     kinase has little to no activity, and Tie1-mediated signaling pathways are
     unknown. To begin to study Tie1 signaling, a recombinant glutathione
     S-transferase (GST)-Tie1 kinase fusion protein was produced in insect
     cells and found to be autophosphorylated in vitro. GST-Tie1 but not a
     kinase-inactive mutant associated with a recombinant p85 SH2 domain
     protein in vitro, suggesting that Tie1 might signal through
     phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. To study Tie1 signaling in a cellular
     context, a c-fms-Tie1 chimeric receptor (fTie1) was expressed in NIH 3T3
     cells. Ligand stimulation of fTie1 resulted in Tie1 autophosphorylation
     and downstream activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt. Stimulation of
     fTie1-expressing cells potently inhibited UV irradiation-induced apoptosis
     in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Moreover, both Akt phosphorylation and
     inhibition of apoptosis were abrogated by mutation of tyrosine 1113 to
     phenylalanine, suggesting that this residue is an important PI 3-kinase
     binding site. These findings are the first biochemical demonstration of a
     signal transduction pathway and corresponding cellular function for Tie1,
     and the antiapoptotic effect of Tie1 is consistent with the results of
     previous genetic studies.

TI  - Analysis of beta3-endonexin mutants for their ability to interact with
     cyclin A.
PG  - 664-71
AB  - We have recently identified beta(3)-endonexin as a molecule that interacts
     with cyclin A-associated kinase. In this study, beta(3)-endonexin mutants
     were constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, and
     characterized. Beta(3)-endonexin has a cyclin binding motif, RxL, in its
     N-terminal region, and two SP sequences which resemble a known target site
     for cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). The R5A/L7A mutant of
     beta(3)-endonexin, in which the RxL motif has been changed to AxA, is
     unable to bind to cyclin A, as revealed by two-hybrid experiments and in
     vitro pull-down assays. A GST-beta(3)-endonexin fusion, but not the
     corresponding R5A/L7A mutant, inhibits phosphorylation of Rb protein by
     cyclin A/Cdk2 in vitro. A cyclin A/Cdk2 kinase complex produced in, and
     purified from, insect cells phosphorylated GST-beta(3)-endonexin in vitro.
     The S33A or S46A mutant is partially phosphorylated by cyclin A/Cdk2,
     whereas no phosphorylation of the S33A/S46A double mutant is detectable.
     This demonstrates that these two serine residues, each of which is
     followed by a proline residue, are target sites for phosphorylation by
     cyclin A-associated kinase. The R5A/L7A mutant form of beta(3)-endonexin,
     which is defective for binding to cyclin A, is also not phosphorylated by
     cyclin A/Cdk2, confirming that the phosphorylation requires binding to
     cyclin A in the kinase complex. The neutralizing effect of
     beta(3)-endonexin on the toxicity associated with the expression of
     full-length human cyclin A in budding yeast is correlated with its ability
     to bind to cyclin A. Taken together, these data suggest that
     beta(3)-endonexin is phosphorylated by cyclinA/Cdk2 in vitro and that
     cyclin A-associated kinase activity is inhibited by the binding of
     beta(3)-endonexin to the kinase complex.

PG  - 167-74
AB  - Full length clones of ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP)
     from Chironomus tentans were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli
     and purified by affinity chromatography. The absence of detergents during
     the purification procedure is essential for retaining receptor function,
     especially ligand binding. Presence of USP is mandatory for ligand binding
     to EcR, but no other cofactors or posttranslational modifications seem to
     be important, since Scatchard plots revealed the same characteristics (two
     high affinity binding sites for Ponasterone A with K(D1)=0.24+/-0.1nM and
     K(D2)=3.9+/-1.3.nM) as found in 0.4 M NaCl extracts of Chironomus cells.
     Gel mobility shift assays showed binding of the heterodimer to PAL and DR5
     even after removal of the GST-tag, whereas EcR binding to PAL1 is
     GST-dependent. USP binds preferentially to DR5. Addition of unprogrammed
     reticulocyte lysate improves ligand binding only slightly. Removal of GST
     has no effect on (3)H-ponasterone A binding, but alters DNA binding
     characteristics. Calculation of specific binding (5.3+3.0 nmol/mg GST EcR)
     revealed that 47+/-26% of purified receptor protein was able to bind
     ligand. The addition of purified EcR to cell extracts of hormone resistant
     subclones of the epithelial cell line from C. tentans, which have lost
     their ability to bind ligand, restores specific binding of
     (3)H-ponasterone A.

TI  - Characterization of human taurine transporter expressed in insect cells
     using a recombinant baculovirus.
PG  - 389-97
AB  - A recombinant baculovirus system was used to express the human taurine
     transporter in Sf9 cells and characterize its mediated uptake activity.
     This uptake process exhibited: (i) Na(+) dependence, (ii) larger
     inhibition of taurine transport by competing beta-amino acids than by
     alpha- and gamma-amino acids, (iii) apparent Michaelis constant, K(t), for
     taurine transport of 1.6 +/- 0.2 microM, and (iv) a maximal velocity,
     V(max), of 262 +/- 18 pmol/mg protein per 15 min. Coexpression of a
     molecular chaperone, human calnexin, enhanced taurine transporter activity
     by 43%. During development of taurine transporter expression, exposure to
     tunicamycin (10 microg/ml) decreased taurine transport activity by 76%.
     The taurine transporter linked to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was
     expressed to determine whether this conjugate also elicits taurine
     transport activity. Even though transport activity was markedly decreased,
     its Na(+) dependence was still evident. Coexpression of calnexin enhanced
     expression of this conjugated transporter activity by 54%. Immunoblot
     analysis revealed that calnexin did not change the amount of GST-taurine
     transporter conjugate or its molecular mass (i.e., 58.4-68.0 kDa).
     However, tunicamycin decreased its molecular mass. Taken together, taurine
     transport activity in a baculovirus expression system has characteristics
     similar to its wild-type counterpart. Stimulation of transport activity by
     coexpression with calnexin suggests the importance of transporter folding
     for optimal transport activity. Glycosylation of the transporter also
     increases its transport activity. Finally, GST-taurine transporter
     conjugate usage may aid transporter purification even though its transport
     activity decreases.

TI  - Dimerization-induced activation of soluble insulin/IGF-1 receptor kinases:
     an alternative mechanism of activation.
PG  - 14268-78
AB  - To study the role of kinase dimerization in the activation of the insulin
     receptor (IR) and the insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF-1R), we
     have cloned, expressed, and purified monomeric and dimeric forms of the
     corresponding soluble kinase domains via the baculovirus expression
     system. Dimerization of the kinases was achieved by fusion of the kinase
     domains to the homodimeric glutathione S-transferase (GST). Kinetic
     analyses revealed that kinase dimerization results in substantial
     increases (10-100-fold) in the phosphotransferase activity in both the
     auto- and substrate phosphorylation reactions. Furthermore, kinase
     dimerization rendered the autophosphorylation reaction
     concentration-independent. However, whereas dimerization was required for
     the rapid autophosphorylation of the kinases, it was not essential for the
     enhanced kinase activity in substrate phosphorylation reactions.
     Comparison of HPLC-phosphopeptide maps of the monomeric and dimeric
     kinases revealed that dimerization leads to an increased phosphorylation
     of the regulatory activation loop of the kinases, strongly suggesting that
     bis- and trisphosphorylation of the activation loop are mediated by
     transphosphorylation within the kinase dimers. Most strikingly, limited
     proteolysis revealed that GST-mediated dimerization by itself had a major
     impact on the conformation of the activation loop by stabilizing a
     conformation that corresponds to the active, phosphorylated form of the
     kinase. Thus, in analogy to the insulin/IGF-1-ligated holoreceptors, the
     dimeric GST-kinases are primed to rapid autophosphorylation by an increase
     in the local concentration of both phosphoryl donor and phosphoryl
     acceptor sites and by a dimerization-induced conformational change of the
     activation loop that leads to an efficient transphosphorylation of the
     regulatory tyrosine residues.

     myosin. Here we investigated cingulin interaction with actin, using
     His-tagged, full-length Xenopus laevis cingulin expressed in insect cells,
     and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of fragments of
     cingulin expressed in bacteria. Purified full-length cingulin co-pelleted
     with F-actin after high speed centrifugation, and promoted the
     sedimentation of F-actin under low speed centrifugation, suggesting that
     cingulin is an actin-cross-linking protein. The actin interaction of GST
     fusion proteins containing fragments of Xenopus cingulin suggested that
     the F-actin binding site is between residues 101 and 294.

TI  - A conserved domain in arthropod cuticular proteins binds chitin.
PG  - 1083-93
AB  - Many insect cuticular proteins include a 35-36 amino acid motif known as
     the R&R consensus. The extensive conservation of this region led to the
     suggestion that it functions to bind chitin. Provocatively, it has no
     sequence similarity to the well-known cysteine-containing chitin-binding
     domain found in chitinases and some peritrophic membrane proteins. Using
     fusion proteins expressed in E. coli, we show that an extended form of the
     R&R consensus from proteins of hard cuticles is necessary and sufficient
     for chitin binding. Recombinant AGCP2b, a putative cuticular protein from
     the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, was expressed in E. coli and the purified
     protein shown to bind to chitin beads. A stretch of 65 amino acids from
     AGCP2b, including the R&R consensus, conferred chitin binding to
     glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Directed mutagenesis of some conserved
     amino acids within this extended R&R consensus from hard cuticle
     eliminated chitin binding. Thus arthropods have two distinct classes of
     chitin binding proteins, those with the chitin-binding domain found in
     lectins, chitinases and peritrophic membranes (cysCBD) and those with the
     cuticular protein chitin-binding domain (non-cysCBD).

TI  - Ostip2, a novel oncoprotein that associates with the Rho exchange factor
     Ost.
PG  - 383-90
AB  - The ost protooncogene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the
     Rho family of small GTPases, RhoA and Cdc42. The N-terminal domain of Ost
     (Ost-N) appears to negatively regulate the oncogenic activity of the
     protein, as deletion of this domain drastically increases its transforming
     activity in NIH 3T3 cells. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified
     five genes encoding proteins that can interact with Ost-N. One of them,
     designated OSTIP2 (Ost interacting protein 2), encoded a previously
     uncharacterized protein. The OSTIP2 product is highly expressed in
     skeletal muscle as a 1.2-kb transcript. Full-length OSTIP2 cDNA contained
     an ORF of 193 amino acids. Transcription-coupled translation of OSTIP2
     cDNA in reticulocyte lysates revealed a protein product of 20 kDa, which
     corresponded to the predicted size of the protein. Bacterially expressed
     glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Ostip2 fusion protein efficiently
     associated in vitro with baculovirus-expressed Ost. Interestingly,
     expression of Ostip2 in NIH 3T3 cells efficiently induced foci of
     morphologically transformed cells. Moreover, inoculation of athymic (nude)
     mice with OSTIP2 transfectants strongly induced tumor formation. These
     results suggest that Ostip2 is a novel oncoprotein that can interact with
     the Rho exchange factor Ost.

PG  - 25-30
AB  - Using an Escherichia coli expression system, pGEX-2T, that expresses
     foreign sequences as fusion proteins with a glutathione S-transferase
     (GST) carrier, we have expressed a virus enhancing factor (EF) from
     Pseudaletia separata entomopoxvirus, which enhances P. unipuncta multi
     nucleopolyhedrovirus (PsunMNPV) infection in larvae of the armyworm, P.
     separata. The lysates of transformed E. coli cells, which were not active
     in enhancing PsunMNPV infection, became active when treated with either
     trypsin or thrombin. The GST-EF fusion protein in a lysate was purified
     with a bulk GST purification module and cleaved into the EF and GST
     moieties with thrombin. Removal of the GST moiety with
     glutathione-Sepharose 4B resulted in a highly purified EF preparation,
     which enhanced PsunMNPV infection in armyworm larvae and PsunMNPV fusion
     with an armyworm cell line, SIE-MSH-805-F.

     glutathione S-transferases from a single Anopheles gene.
PG  - 867-75
AB  - Three cDNA sequences of glutathione S-transferase (GST), adgst1-2,
     adgst1-3 and adgst1-4, which are alternatively spliced products of the
     adgst1AS1 gene, were obtained from fourth instar larvae of Anopheles dirus
     mosquito by reverse transcriptase PCR reactions. The nucleotide sequences
     of these three cDNAs share >67% identity and the translated amino acid
     sequences share 61-64% identity. A comparison of the An. dirus to the An.
     gambiae enzymes shows that adGST1-2 versus agGST1-4, adGST1-3 versus
     agGST1-5 and adGST1-4 versus agGST1-3 have 85, 92 and 85% amino acid
     sequence identity, respectively, which confirms that orthologous
     isoenzymes occur across anopheline species. These three proteins were
     expressed at high levels, approximately 15-20 mg from 200 ml of E. coli
     culture. The recombinant enzymes were purified by affinity chromatography
     on an S-hexylglutathione agarose column. The subunit sizes of adGST1-2,
     adGST1-3 and adGST1-4 are 24.3, 23.9 and 25.1 kDa. The recombinant enzymes
     have high activities with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), detectable
     activity with 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene but markedly low activity with
     ethacrynic acid and p-nitrophenethyl bromide. adGST1-3 was shown to be the
     most active enzyme from the kinetic studies. Permethrin inhibition of CDNB
     activity, at varying concentrations of CDNB, was significantly different,
     being uncompetitive for adGST1-2, noncompetitive for adGST1-3 and
     competitive for adGST1-4. In contrast, permethrin inhibition with varying
     glutathione concentrations was noncompetitive for all three GSTs. Despite
     the enzymes being splicing products of the same gene and sharing identical
     sequence in the N-terminal 45 amino acids, these GSTs show distinct
     substrate specificities, kinetic properties and inhibition properties
     modulated by the differences in the C-terminus.

TI  - Epstein-Barr virus-encoded protein kinase BGLF4 mediates
     hyperphosphorylation of cellular elongation factor 1delta (EF-1delta):
     EF-1delta is universally modified by conserved protein kinases of
     herpesviruses in mammalian cells.
PG  - 1457-63
AB  - Translation elongation factor 1delta (EF-1delta) is hyperphosphorylated in
     various mammalian cells infected with alpha-, beta- and gammaherpesviruses
     and EF-1delta modification is mediated by viral protein kinases, including
     UL13 of herpes simplex virus type 1 and UL97 of human cytomegalovirus. In
     this study, the following is reported. (i) BGLF4 encoded by the prototype
     gammaherpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus was purified as a fusion protein that
     was labelled with [gamma-(32)P]ATP and labelling was eliminated by
     phosphatase. (ii) The ratio of the hyperphosphorylated form of human
     EF-1delta was increased both in Sf9 cells after infection with
     baculoviruses expressing GST-BGLF4 fusion proteins and in COS-7 cells
     after transfection with a BGLF4 expression plasmid. These results indicate
     that purified BGLF4 possesses protein kinase activity and mediates
     EF-1delta hyperphosphorylation. These data also support the hypothesis
     that the protein kinases that are conserved by herpesviruses universally
     mediate EF-1delta modification in mammalian cells.

TI  - Suramin and the suramin analogue NF307 discriminate among
     calmodulin-binding sites.
PG  - 827-33
AB  - Calmodulin-binding sites on target proteins show considerable variation in
     primary sequence; hence compounds that block the access of calmodulin to
     these binding sites may be more selective than compounds that inactivate
     calmodulin. Suramin and its analogue NF307 inhibit the interaction of
     calmodulin with the ryanodine receptor. We have investigated whether
     inhibition of calmodulin binding to target proteins is a general property
     of these compounds. Suramin inhibited binding of [(125)I]calmodulin to
     porcine brain membranes and to sarcoplasmic reticulum from skeletal muscle
     (IC(50)=4.9+/-1.2 microM and 19.9+/-1.8 microM, respectively) and blocked
     the cross-linking of [(125)I]calmodulin to some, but not all, target
     proteins in brain membranes by [(125)I]calmodulin. Four calmodulin-binding
     proteins were purified [ryanodine receptor-1 (RyR1) from rabbit skeletal
     muscle, neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) from Sf9 cells, G-protein betagamma
     dimers (Gbetagamma) from porcine brain and a glutathione
     S-transferase-fusion protein comprising the C-terminal calmodulin-binding
     domain of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7A (GST-CmGluR7A) from
     bacterial lysates]. Three of the proteins employed (Gbetagamma,
     GST-CmGluR7A and RyR1) display a comparable affinity for calmodulin (in
     the range of 50-70 nM). Nevertheless, suramin and NF307 only blocked the
     binding of Gbetagamma and RyR1 to calmodulin-Sepharose. In contrast, the
     association of GST-CmGluR7A and nNOS was not impaired, whereas excess
     calmodulin uniformly displaced all proteins from the matrix. Thus suramin
     and NF307 are prototypes of a new class of calmodulin antagonists that do
     not interact directly with calmodulin but with calmodulin-recognition
     sites. In addition, these compounds discriminate among calmodulin-binding
     motifs.

TI  - Expression and purification of human recombinant GST-FGF receptor-1.
PG  - 51-8
AB  - When tumors undergo the angiogenic switch, cell growth and tissue invasion
     is facilitated by the formation of new capillaries from preexisting blood
     vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Growth factors such as vascular
     endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) and
     fibroblast growth factor (FGF) trigger the process of angiogenesis. Here
     we describe a protocol for the expression and one-step purification of
     human recombinant GST-FGF receptor type 1 (FGFR-1) from Sf9 cells. This
     protocol allows generating an active kinase as indicated by its reactivity
     with a monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated tyrosine. The purified enzyme
     displays a specific activity of 1.2 x 10(4) pmol mg(-1) min(-1), which is
     in the range of activities reported for homogeneously purified recombinant
     kinases. We have employed a number of compounds to show that the
     GST-FGFR-1 preparation is suitable to the identification of tyrosine
     kinase inhibitors. Considering that inhibitors of angiogenesis may
     represent an attractive tool in therapeutic strategies targeting invasive
     metastatic tumors the results presented here, along with available data on
     the structure of the ATP-binding pocket of FGFR-1, should facilitate the
     rational design of specific FGFR-1 inhibitory compounds.

PG  - 13848-55
AB  - We have isolated human cDNA for a novel type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1)
     inhibitory protein, named inhibitor-4 (I-4), from a cDNA library of germ
     cell tumors. I-4, composed of 202 amino acids, is 44% identical to a PP1
     inhibitor, inhibitor-2 (I-2). I-4 conserves functionally important
     structure of I-2 and exhibited similar biochemical properties. I-4
     inhibited activity of the catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1C), specifically
     with an IC(50) of 0.2 nM, more potently than I-2 with an IC(50) of 2 nM.
     I-4 weakly inhibited the activity of myosin-associated phosphates (PP1M).
     However, the level of inhibition of PP1M was increased during
     preincubation of PP1M with I-4, suggesting that the inhibition is caused
     by interaction of I-4 with PP1C in such a manner that it competes with the
     M subunit of PP1M. Gel overlay experiments showed that I-4 binds PP1C
     directly. Three I-4 peptides containing the N-terminal residues 1-123,
     1-131, and 1-142 all showed strong binding ability to PP1C but did not
     show PP1 inhibitory activity, whereas an I-2 peptide (residues 1-134),
     lacking the corresponding C-terminal residues, potently inhibited PP1C
     activity as previously reported. Removal of the 18 N-terminal amino acid
     residues from I-4 dramatically reduced the PP1 binding activity with a
     correlated loss of inhibitory activity, whereas removal of the 10
     N-terminal residues had only a little effect. The two peptides
     GST-I-4(19-131) and GST-I-4(132-202) showed ability to bind to PP1C,
     albeit very weakly. These results strongly suggest a multiple-point
     interaction between I-4 and PP1C, which is thought to cause the inhibition
     of I-4 which is stronger than the inhibition of I-2.

     urea. The recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) was purified by a batch method using
     Glutathione Sepharose 4B and factor Xa digestion and used for preparation
     of antisera in mice. The antisera reacted with rIL-2 expressed in
     baculovirus system on immunoblot analysis. In addition, the purified rIL-2
     showed a high biological activity on CTLL-2 proliferative response.

     cleavage and protein glycosylation in bioactivity.
PG  - 60-6
AB  - The hepatitis C virus glycoproteins E1 and 2 have been expressed using
     recombinant baculoviruses following fusion to the carrier protein
     glutathione S-transferase (GST). Proteins were expressed singly and as an
     E1E2 polyprotein with and without an N-terminal affinity tag. Expression
     of the E1E2 polyprotein, even when preceded by GST, led to processing in
     insect cells and detection of an E1E2 complex that could be specifically
     purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. Baculovirus expressed E2
     and a purified GST-E1E2 protein bound to the second extracellular loop of
     CD81 (EC2), a reported ligand for the molecule, but not to a truncated
     derivative of CD81 consisting of only the central domain of the loop.
     Purified GST-E2, however, failed to bind to CD81 suggesting a requirement
     for a free E2 amino terminus for biological activity. The binding to CD81
     by baculovirus expressed E2 protein was comparable to that observed for E2
     derived from mammalian cells when detected by a monoclonal antibody
     sensitive to protein conformation. Furthermore, E2 protein expressed in
     insect cells in the presence of N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of
     terminal glucose residue processing, formed complexes with E1 and bound to
     CD81-EC2 similarly to untreated protein. Together these data suggest that
     although hyperglucosylation of E2 does not have a major effect on
     bioactivity, polyprotein processing to reveal the free amino terminus is
     required.

TI  - Human Cdc7-related kinase complex. In vitro phosphorylation of MCM by
     concerted actions of Cdks and Cdc7 and that of a criticial threonine
     residue of Cdc7 bY Cdks.
PG  - 29042-52
AB  - huCdc7 encodes a catalytic subunit for Saccharomyces cerevisae
     Cdc7-related kinase complex of human. ASK, whose expression is cell
     cycle-regulated, binds and activates huCdc7 kinase in a cell
     cycle-dependent manner (Kumagai, H., Sato, N., Yamada, M., Mahony, D. ,
     Seghezzi, W., Lees, E., Arai, K., and Masai, H. (1999) Mol. Cell. Biol.
     19, 5083-5095). We have expressed huCdc7 complexed with ASK regulatory
     subunit using the insect cell expression system. To facilitate
     purification of the kinase complex, glutathione S-transferase (GST) was
     fused to huCdc7 and GST-huCdc7-ASK complex was purified. GST-huCdc7
     protein is inert as a kinase on its own, and phosphorylation absolutely
     depends on the presence of the ASK subunit. It autophosphorylates both
     subunits in vitro and phosphorylates a number of replication proteins to
     different extents. Among them, MCM2 protein, either in a free form or in a
     MCM2-4-6-7 complex, serves as an excellent substrate for huCdc7-ASK kinase
     complex in vitro. MCM4 and MCM6 are also phosphorylated by huCdc7 albeit
     to less extent. MCM2 and -4 in the MCM2-4-6-7 complex are phosphorylated
     by Cdks as well, and prior phosphorylation of the MCM2-4-6-7 complex by
     Cdks facilitates phosphorylation of MCM2 by huCdc7, suggesting
     collaboration between Cdks and Cdc7 in phosphorylation of MCM for
     initiation of S phase. huCdc7 and ASK proteins can also be phosphorylated
     by Cdks in vitro. Among four possible Cdk phosphorylation sites of huCdc7,
     replacement of Thr-376, corresponding to the activating threonine of Cdk,
     with alanine (T376A mutant) dramatically reduces kinase activity,
     indicative of kinase activation by phosphorylation of this residue. In
     vitro, Cdk2-Cyclin E, Cdk2-Cyclin A, and Cdc2-Cyclin B, but not
     Cdk4-Cyclin D1, phosphorylates the Thr-376 residue of huCdc7, suggesting
     possible regulation of huCdc7 by Cdks.

     characterization and removal from glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion
     proteins.
PG  - 197-201
AB  - After affinity purification on immobilized glutathione,
     insect-cell-derived glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins
     contain variable amounts of protein contaminants of about 23-24 kDa. We
     have isolated these glutathione-binding proteins from the widely used Sf9
     and Hi5 insect cell lines and characterized them by LC-MS and N-terminal
     sequencing. Based on the observation that these proteins have higher
     affinity for glutathione than GST fusions, we have found that by using
     differential elution conditions the amount of such contaminants in GST
     fusion preparations can be strongly reduced directly during the affinity
     purification step. The main interest of these results is that they are not
     restricted to a specific construct, but rather they seem to apply to
     various insect-cell-derived GST fusions.

     nucleocapsid protein.
PG  - 266-74
AB  - Dobrava hantavirus (DOBV) causes severe hemorrhagic fever with renal
     syndrome in the Balkan region and has been detected recently also in
     Russia, Estonia, and Germany. DOBV nucleocapsid protein (N) was produced
     in insect cells, using the baculovirus expression system (bac-DOBV-N), and
     in E. coli as a truncated (aa 1-165) glutathione-S transferase fusion
     protein (DOBV-dN-GST). The antigenic properties of bac-DOBV-N were found
     identical to native DOBV-N when examined by a panel of hantavirus-specific
     monoclonal antibodies. Enzyme immunoassays for detection of IgM and IgG
     antibodies were set up using DOBV recombinant N proteins and compared with
     those based on recombinant Hantaan and Puumala virus N, using panels of
     sera collected from DOBV, Hantaan and Puumala virus-infected patients.
     Full-length N protein (bac-DOBV-N) was found to be a more sensitive
     antigen than DOBV-dN-GST. The sensitivity values for sera from
     DOBV-infected patients were 100% for bac-DOBV-N and 86% for DOBV-dN-GST by
     IgM assays, and 98% for bac-DOBV-N and 88% for DOBV-dN-GST by IgG assays.
     The specificity values were 100% for bac-DOBV-N and 99% for DOBV-dN-GST by
     IgM assays, and 100% for both antigens by IgG assays.

TI  - N-Glycan processing by a lepidopteran insect alpha1,2-mannosidase.
PG  - 347-55
AB  - Protein glycosylation pathways are relatively poorly characterized in
     insect cells. As part of an overall effort to address this problem, we
     previously isolated a cDNA from Sf9 cells that encodes an insect
     alpha1,2-mannosidase (SfManI) which requires calcium and is inhibited by
     1-deoxymannojirimycin. In the present study, we have characterized the
     substrate specificity of SfManI. A recombinant baculovirus was used to
     express a GST-tagged secreted form of SfManI which was purified from the
     medium using an immobilized glutathione column. The purified SfManI was
     then incubated with oligosaccharide substrates and the resulting products
     were analyzed by HPLC. These analyses showed that SfManI rapidly converts
     Man(9)GlcNAc(2)to Man(6)Glc-NAc(2)isomer C, then more slowly converts
     Man(6)GlcNAc(2)isomer C to Man(5)GlcNAc(2). The slow step in the
     processing of Man(9)GlcNAc(2)to Man(5)GlcNAc(2)by SfManI is removal of the
     alpha1,2-linked mannose on the middle arm of Man(9)GlcNAc(2). In this
     respect, SfManI is similar to mammalian alpha1,2-mannosidases IA and IB.
     However, additional HPLC and(1)H-NMR analyses demonstrated that SfManI
     converts Man(9)GlcNAc(2)to Man(5)GlcNAc(2)primarily through
     Man(7)GlcNAc(2)isomer C, the archetypal Man(9)GlcNAc(2)missing the lower
     arm alpha1,2-linked mannose residues. In this respect, SfManI differs from
     mammalian alpha1,2-mannosidases IA and IB, and is the first
     alpha1,2-mannosidase directly shown to produce Man(7)GlcNAc(2)isomer C as
     a major processing intermediate.

TI  - Molecular cloning of a cDNA for a small GTP binding protein, BRho, from
     the embryo of Bombyx mori and its characterization after expression and
     purification.
PG  - 165-72
AB  - A cDNA clone encoding a small GTP binding protein (Brho) was isolated from
     an embryonic cDNA library of Bombyx mori that encoded a polypeptide with
     202 amino acids sharing 60-80% similarity with the Rho1 family of GTP
     binding proteins. The effector site and one of the guanine nucleotide
     binding sites differed from other members of the Rho family. To
     characterize the biochemical properties of Brho, the clone was expressed
     in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein.
     The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity with glutathione
     S-Sepharose. The fusion protein bound [(35)S] GTPgammaS and [(3)H] GDP
     with association constants of 11x10(6) M(-1) and 6.2x10(6) M(-1),
     respectively. The binding of [(35)S] GTPgammaS was inhibited by GTP and
     GDP, but by no other nucleotides. The calculated GTP-hydrolysis activity
     was 89.6 m mol/min/mol of Brho. Bound [(35)S] GTPgammaS and [(3)H] GDP
     were exchanged with GTPgammaS most efficiently in the presence of 6 mM
     MgCl(2). These results suggest that Brho has a higher affinity for GTP
     than GDP, converts from the GTP-bound state into the GDP-bound state by
     intrinsic GTP hydrolytic activity, and returns to the GTP-bound state with
     the exchange of GDP with GTP. Arch.

TI  - Cloning of three novel neuronal Cdk5 activator binding proteins.
PG  - 285-94
AB  - Neuronal Cdc2-like kinase (Nclk) is involved in the regulation of neuronal
     differentiation and neuro-cytoskeleton dynamics. The active kinase
     consists of a catalytic subunit, Cdk5, and a 25 kDa activator protein
     (p25nck5a) derived from a 35 kDa neuronal-specific protein (p35nck5a). As
     an extension of our previous study (Qi, Z., Tang, D., Zhu, X., Fujita,
     D.J., Wang, J.H., 1998. Association of neurofilament proteins with
     neuronal Cdk5 activator. J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2329-2335), which showed that
     neurofilament is one of the p35nck5a-associated proteins, we now report
     the isolation of three other novel p35nck5a-associated proteins using the
     yeast two-hybrid screen. The full-length forms of these three novel
     proteins, designated C42, C48 and C53, have a molecular mass of 66, 24,
     and 57 kDa, respectively. Northern analysis indicates that these novel
     proteins are widely expressed in human tissues, including the heart,
     brain, skeletal muscle, placenta, lung, liver, kidney and pancreas. The
     bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion forms of
     these three proteins were able to co-precipitate p35nck5a complexed with
     Cdk5 from insect cell lysate. Among these three proteins, only C48 and C53
     can be phosphorylated by Nclk, suggesting that they may be the substrates
     of Nclk. Sequence homology searches have suggested that the C48 protein is
     marginally related to restin protein, whereas the C42 protein has
     homologues of unknown function in Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis
     thaliana.

     serine protease present in human erythrocyte cytosol (Fujino et al., J.
     Biochem. 124 (1998) 1077-1085) that is adherent to oxidized erythrocyte
     membranes and preferentially degrades oxidatively damaged proteins (Beppu
     et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1196 (1994) 81-87; Fujino et al., Biochim.
     Biophys. Acta 1374 (1998) 47-55) was determined. The N-terminal amino acid
     of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP)-labeled OPH was suggested to be
     masked. Six peptide fragments of OPH obtained by digestion of DFP-labeled
     OPH with lysyl endopeptidase were isolated by use of reverse-phase
     high-performance liquid chromatography, and the sequence of more than
     eight amino acids from the N-terminal position of each peptide was
     determined. Results of homology search of amino acid sequence of each
     peptide strongly suggested that the protein was identical with human liver
     acylpeptide hydrolase (ACPH). OPH showed ACPH activity when
     N-acetyl-L-alanine p-nitroanilide and N-acetylmethionyl L-alanine were
     used as substrates. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged recombinant
     ACPH (rACPH) was prepared by use of baculovirus expression system as a
     107-kDa protein from cDNA of human erythroleukemic cell line K-562. rACPH
     reacted with anti-OPH antiserum from rabbit. rACPH showed OPH activity
     when hydrogen peroxide-oxidized or glycated bovine serum albumin was used
     as substrates. As well as the enzyme activities of OPH, those of rACPH
     were inhibited by DFP. The results clearly demonstrate that ACPH, whose
     physiological function has not yet been well characterized, can play an
     important role as OPH in destroying oxidatively damaged proteins in living
     cells.

TI  - Formation of the Ras dimer is essential for Raf-1 activation.
PG  - 3737-40
AB  - Although it is well established that Ras requires membrane localization
     for activation of its target molecule, Raf-1, the reason for this
     requirement is not fully understood. In this study, we found that modified
     Ras, which is purified from Sf9 cells, could activate Raf-1 in a cell-free
     system, when incorporated into liposome. Using a bifunctional cross-linker
     and a protein-fragmentation complementation assay, we detected dimer
     formation of Ras in the liposome and in the intact cells, respectively.
     These results suggest that dimerization of Ras in the lipid membrane is
     essential for activation of Raf-1. To support this, we found that, when
     fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), unprocessed Ras expressed in
     Escherichia coli could bypass the requirement for liposome. A
     Ras-dependent Raf-1 activator, which we previously reported (Mizutani, S.,
     Koide, H., and Kaziro, Y. (1998) Oncogene 16, 2781-2786), was still
     required for Raf-1 activation by GST-Ras. Furthermore, an enforced
     dimerization of unmodified oncogenic Ras mutant in human embryonic kidney
     (HEK) 293 cells, using a portion of gyrase B or estrogen receptor, also
     resulted in activation of Raf-1. From these results, we conclude that
     membrane localization allows Ras to form a dimer, which is essential,
     although not sufficient, for Raf-1 activation.

PG  - 952-9
AB  - RNA polymerase II from the fission yeast Schizo-saccharomyces pombe
     consists of 12 species of subunits, Rpb1-Rpb12. We expressed these
     subunits, except Rpb4, simultaneously in cultured insect cells with
     baculovirus expression vectors. For the isolation of subunit complexes
     formed in the virus-infected cells, a glutathione S -transferase (GST)
     sequence was fused to the rpb3 cDNA to produce GST-Rpb3 fusion protein and
     a decahistidine-tag sequence was inserted into the rpb1 cDNA to produce
     Rpb1H protein. After successive affinity chromatography on glutathione and
     Ni(2+)columns, complexes consisting of the seven subunits, Rpb1H, Rpb2,
     GST-Rpb3, Rpb5, Rpb7, Rpb8 and Rpb11, were identified. Omission of the
     GST-Rpb3 expression resulted in reduced assembly of the Rpb11 into the
     complex. Direct interaction between Rpb3 and the other six subunits was
     detected by pairwise coexpression experiments. Coexpression of various
     combinations of a few subunits revealed that Rpb11 enhances Rpb3-Rpb8
     interaction and consequently Rpb8 enhances Rpb1-Rpb3 interaction to some
     extent. We propose a mechanism in which the assembly of RNA poly-merase II
     is stabilized through multiple subunit-subunit contacts.

TI  - MSL1 plays a central role in assembly of the MSL complex, essential for
     dosage compensation in Drosophila.
PG  - 144-55
AB  - In male Drosophila, histone H4 acetylated at Lys16 is enriched on the X
     chromosome, and most X-linked genes are transcribed at a higher rate than
     in females (thus achieving dosage compensation). Five proteins,
     collectively called the MSLs, are required for dosage compensation and
     male viability. Here we show that one of these proteins, MSL1, interacts
     with three others, MSL2, MSL3 and MOF. The latter is a putative histone
     acetyl transferase. Overexpression of either the N- or C-terminal domain
     of MSL1 has dominant-negative effects, i.e. causes male-specific
     lethality. The lethality due to expression of the N-terminal domain is
     reduced if msl2 is co-overexpressed. MSL2 co-purifies over a FLAG affinity
     column with the tagged region of MSL1, and both MSL3 and MOF co-purify
     with the FLAG-tagged MSL1 C-terminal domain. Furthermore, the MSL1
     C-terminal domain binds specifically to a GST-MOF fusion protein and
     co-immunoprecipitates with HA-tagged MSL3. The MSL1 C-terminal domain
     shows similarity to a region of mouse CBP, a transcription co-activator.
     We conclude that a main role of MSL1 is to serve as the backbone for
     assembly of the MSL complex.

TI  - Transcription factors of the Sp1 family: interaction with E2F and
     regulation of the murine thymidine kinase promoter.
PG  - 1005-15
AB  - Promoters of growth and cell cycle regulated genes frequently carry
     binding sites for transcription factors of the E2F and Sp1 families. We
     have demonstrated recently that direct interaction between Sp1 and a
     subgroup of the E2F factors is essential for the regulation of certain
     promoters. We show here that the amino acids necessary for this
     interaction in both cases are located within the DNA binding domain. This
     is in line with the assumption, that the interaction between E2F and
     Sp-factors contributes to promoter-specificity. Cyclin A, which binds to
     E2F-1 in close vicinity to Sp1 does not interfere with this interaction.
     Moreover we have investigated the ability of other members of the Sp1
     family to interact with E2F-1 and to regulate the activity of the E2F and
     Sp1 dependent murine thymidine kinase promoter. All four factors of the
     Sp1 family are able to bind E2F-1 in co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pull
     down experiments. Mobility shift assays with oligonucleotides comprising
     the Sp1, or both the Sp1 and the E2F binding site suggest that Sp1 and Sp3
     supply most if not all activity binding to the GC-box of the thymidine
     kinase promoter in murine fibroblasts. Reporter gene assays in Drosophila
     melanogaster SL2 cells and murine fibroblast 3T6 cells demonstrate that
     the thymidine kinase promoter is activated strongly by Sp1 and Sp3, weakly
     by Sp4, and not at all by Sp2. Co-expression of E2F-1 results in
     synergistic activation in 3T6 but not in SL2 cells.

TI  - c-Jun transactivates the promoter of the human p21(WAF1/Cip1) gene by
     acting as a superactivator of the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1.
PG  - 29572-81
AB  - The cell cycle inhibitor protein p21(WAF1/Cip1) (p21) is a critical
     downstream effector in p53-dependent mechanisms of growth control and
     p53-independent pathways of terminal differentiation. We have recently
     reported that the transforming growth factor-beta pathway-specific Smad3
     and Smad4 proteins transactivate the human p21 promoter via a short
     proximal region, which contains multiple binding sites for the ubiquitous
     transcription factor Sp1. In the present study we show that the
     Sp1-occupied promoter region mediates transactivation of the p21 promoter
     by c-Jun and the related proteins JunB, JunD, and ATF-2. By using gel
     electrophoretic mobility shift assays we show that this region does not
     contain a binding site for c-Jun. In accordance with the DNA binding data,
     c-Jun was unable to transactivate the p21 promoter when overexpressed in
     the Sp1-deficient Drosophila-derived SL2 cells. Coexpression of c-Jun and
     Sp1 in these cells resulted in a strong synergistic transactivation of
     this promoter. In addition, a chimeric promoter consisting of six tandem
     high affinity Sp1-binding sites fused with the CAT gene was transactivated
     by overexpressed c-Jun in HepG2 cells. The above data propose functional
     cooperation between c-Jun and Sp1. Physical interactions between the two
     factors were demonstrated in vitro by using GST-Sp1 hybrid proteins
     expressed in bacteria and in vitro transcribed-translated c-Jun. The
     region of c-Jun mediating interaction with Sp1 was mapped within the basic
     region leucine zipper domain. In vivo, functional interactions between
     c-Jun and Sp1 were demonstrated using a GAL4-based transactivation assay.
     Overexpressed c-Jun transactivated a chimeric promoter consisting of five
     tandem GAL4-binding sites only when coexpressed with GAL4-Sp1-(83-778)
     fusion proteins in HepG2 cells. By utilizing the same assay, we found that
     the glutamine-rich segment of the B domain of Sp1 (Bc, amino acids
     424-542) was sufficient for c-Jun-induced transactivation of the p21
     promoter. In conclusion, our data support a mechanism of superactivation
     of Sp1 by c-Jun, which is based on physical and functional interactions
     between these two transcription factors on the human p21 and possibly
     other Sp1-dependent promoters.

PG  - 83-8
AB  - The plethora of extracellular stimuli modulating the status of a cell
     results in the engagement of relatively few pathways responsible for
     transducing signals to the interior of the cell. One such pathway is the
     activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K), which results in the
     generation of a membrane-restricted second messenger,
     polyphosphatidylinositide 3'-phosphate. Among the enzymes activated by
     3'-phosphorylated inositol lipids is Akt/protein kinase B (PKB). Here we
     describe a protocol for the expression and one-step purification of human
     recombinant GST-PKB in Sf9 cells. This scheme allows generating large
     amounts of homogeneously purified GST-PKB with high specific activity to
     be employed in high-throughput screening or structural studies.

     microfilament-associated retroviral Gag-like protein in a
     xenotransplantable rat mammary tumor.
PG  - 4099-107
AB  - The retroviral Gag-like protein p58gag expressed in a highly metastatic
     ascites rat mammary adenocarcinoma has been implicated in cell surface
     changes contributing to xenotransplantability. p58gag is present in the
     cells in a plasma membrane- and microfilament-associated signal
     transduction particle containing Src and is phosphorylated on tyrosine.
     Overlay analyses and affinity chromatography with glutathione
     S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of Src homology-3 (SH3) domains showed
     direct binding of the Src but not the Crk SH3 domain to p58gag. This
     association was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of partially purified
     p58gag from ascites cell lysates with platelet Src. Further, a GST-p58gag
     fusion protein bound full length c-Src from either platelets or
     c-Src-expressing insect cells. The GST-p58gag fusion protein, but not GST,
     was phosphorylated by platelet or insect cell-expressed c-Src, but not by
     a kinase negative c-Src variant. The binding of GST-p58gag to c-Src was
     almost completely abolished by a 50-fold excess of the GST-SH3 domain of
     Src, and a parallel decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of p58gag was
     observed. These results demonstrate that p58gag is tyrosine-phosphorylated
     as a consequence of its specific association with c-Src via its SH3
     domain. These observations suggest a mechanism by which Gag proteins may
     contribute to retroviral maturation or pathogenesis through binding and
     relocalization of SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Src-like tyrosine
     kinases to sites of association of microfilaments with the plasma
     membrane.

PG  - 3464-9
AB  - Dipteran-specific insecticidal protein Cry4A is produced as a protoxin of
     130 kDa in Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis. Here we performed
     the in vitro processing of Cry4A and showed that the 130-kDa protoxin of
     Cry4A was processed into the two protease-resistant fragments of 20 and 45
     kDa through the intramolecular cleavage of a 60-kDa intermediate. The
     processing into these two fragments was also observed in vivo. To
     investigate functional properties of the two fragments, GST (glutathione
     S-transferase) fusion proteins of the 60-kDa intermediate and the 20- and
     45-kDa fragments were constructed. Neither the GST-20-kDa fusion protein
     (GST-20) nor the GST-45-kDa fusion protein (GST-45) was actively toxic
     against mosquito larvae of Culex pipiens, whereas the GST-60-kDa
     intermediate fusion protein (GST-60) exhibited significant toxicity.
     However, when the two fusion proteins GST-20 and GST-45 coexisted,
     significant toxicity was observed. The coprecipitation experiment
     demonstrated that the two fragments associated with each other. Therefore,
     it is strongly suggested that the two fragments formed an active complex
     of apparently 60 kDa. A mutant of the 60-kDa protein which was apparently
     resistant to the intramolecular cleavage with the midgut extract of C.
     pipiens larvae had toxicity slightly lower than that of GST-60.

PG  - 309-12
AB  - The BCR gene is involved in the formation of the BCR-ABL oncogene
     responsible for the pathogenesis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive human
     leukemias. We have previously shown that P210 BCR-ABL binds to the
     xeroderma pigmentosum group B protein (XPB) through the portion of BCR
     that is homologous to the catalytic domain of GDP-GTP exchangers such as
     yeast CDC24 and Dbl. In the baculovirus overexpression system which
     facilitates binding of coexpressed proteins, we now show that XPB binds to
     the intact BCR protein efficiently but not to CDC24 or Dbl, suggesting
     specificity of this interaction. The binding of endogenous BCR and XPB
     proteins was also detected in Hela cells, and this was inhibited by a
     blocking peptide. Full-length (1-782) XPB and its truncated form
     (203-782), which does not contain the nuclear localization signal, were
     tagged with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and were expressed in Rat1
     fibroblasts. GST-XPB(203-782) was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm
     and bound to BCR but not to p62, one of the other components in TFIIH.
     GST-XPB(1-782) was largely in the nucleus and bound to p62 and BCR.
     Although the biological significance of the binding remains to be
     uncovered, BCR binds to the XPB/p62 complex.

TI  - Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C interacts with histone deacetylase
     to repress transcription.
PG  - 5688-97
AB  - EBNA3C can specifically repress the expression of reporter plasmids
     containing EBV Cp latency-associated promoter elements. Cp is normally the
     main promoter for EBNA mRNA initiation, so it appears that EBNA3C
     contributes to a negative autoregulatory control loop. By mutational
     analysis it was previously established that this repression is consistent
     with EBNA3C being targeted to Cp by binding the cellular sequence-specific
     DNA-binding protein CBF1 (also known as recombination signal-binding
     protein [RBP]-Jkappa. Further analysis suggested that in vivo a
     corepressor interacts with EBNA3C in this DNA binding complex. Results
     presented here are all consistent with a component of such a corepressor
     exhibiting histone deacetylase activity. The drug trichostatin A, which
     specifically inhibits histone deacetylases, relieved two- to threefold the
     repression of Cp induced by EBNA3C in two different cell types. Moreover,
     repression of pTK-CAT-Cp4x by EBNA3C was specifically enhanced by
     cotransfection of an expression plasmid for human histone deacetylase-1
     (HDAC1). Consistent with these functional assays, in vitro-translated
     HDAC1 bound to a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein including
     full-length EBNA3C, and in the reciprocal experiment EBNA3C bound to a GST
     fusion with the N terminus of HDAC1. Coimmunoprecipitations also revealed
     an EBNA3C-HDAC1 interaction in vivo, and GST-EBNA3C bound functional
     histone deacetylase enzyme activity from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The
     region of EBNA3C involved in the interaction with HDAC1 appears to
     correspond to the region which is necessary for binding to
     CBF1/RBP-Jkappa. A direct physical interaction between EBNA3C and HDAC1
     was demonstrated with recombinant proteins purified from bacterial cells,
     and we therefore conclude that HDAC1 and CBF1/RBP-Jkappa bind to the same
     or adjacent regions of EBNA3C. These data suggest that recruitment of
     histone deacetylase activity makes a significant contribution to the
     repression of transcription from Cp because EBNA3C bridges an interaction
     between CBF1/RBP-Jkappa and HDAC1.

TI  - Expression of elongation factor 1 beta' in Escherichia coli and its
     interaction with elongation factor 1 alpha from silk gland.
PG  - 666-71
AB  - Silk gland elongation factor 1 (EF-1) consists of four subunits: alpha,
     beta, beta', and gamma. EF-1 beta beta' gamma catalyzes the exchange of
     GDP for GTP on EF-1 alpha and stimulates the binding of EF-1
     alpha-dependent aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes. The carboxy-terminal regions
     of the EF-1 beta subunits from various species are highly conserved. We
     examined the region of EF-1 beta' that binds to EF-1 alpha by in vitro
     binding assays, and examined the GDP/GTP exchange activity using deletion
     mutants of a GST-EF1 beta' fusion protein. We thereby suggested a pivotal
     amino acid region, residues 189-222, of EF-1 beta' for binding to EF-1
     alpha.

TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the PTEN/MMAC1 pseudogene, psiPTEN.
PG  - 1765-9
AB  - PTEN/MMAC1 is a recently characterized tumor suppressor. A pseudogene
     derived from the human PTEN/MMAC1 phosphatase, psiPTEN, has been reported.
     Recent analysis of the pseudogene revealed conflicting results about the
     expression of psiPTEN. In this study, we show that the PTEN/MMAC1
     pseudogene is actively transcribed in all cells and tissues examined. In
     some cases, pseudogene transcripts were found to represent as much as 70%
     of the total PTEN/MMAC1 RNA. As psiPTEN is transcribed, there is a
     potential for misinterpretation of PTEN/MMAC1 mutations when RT-PCR
     techniques are used, as well as potential for a psiPTEN-encoded
     translation product. Although we were unable to detect a pseudogene
     protein product in the cell lines examined, a baculovirus produced GST
     pseudogene fusion protein exhibited phosphatase activity comparable to
     wild type. The results of this study, taken together, indicate the
     potential complication of PTEN/MMAC1 molecular analysis caused by the
     expression of psiPTEN.

     human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 proteins associated with the latent (ORF73) and
     lytic (ORFs 65, K8.1A, and K8.1B) replicative cycles and in
     immunofluorescence assays with HHV-8-infected BCBL-1 cells.
PG  - 381-92
AB  - The development of reliable, sensitive, and specific serological methods
     for the detection of human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) antibodies is critical
     for a thorough understanding of HHV-8 prevalence and pathogenesis. To
     evaluate the potential usefulness of HHV-8 proteins in measuring the
     responses against both latent and lytic antigens, we selected 1 latent
     [open reading frame (ORF) 73] antigen and 3 HHV-8 lytic antigens (ORFs 65,
     K8.1A, and K8.1B) previously identified as immunogenic [Virology (1998)
     243, 208-217]. Full-length genomic ORF 73 and full-length ORFs 65, K8.1A,
     and K8.1B from the cDNA clones were cloned, expressed in bacterial and
     baculovirus-insect cell expression systems, and purified as GST fusion
     proteins. These recombinant proteins were used in Western blot reactions
     to test sera from 104 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)+/Kaposi's sarcoma
     (KS)+ homosexual men, 77 HIV+/KS- homosexual men, and 84 age-matched
     HIV-/KS- men. These sera were also tested in immunofluorescence assays
     (IFAs) with uninduced and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced B
     cell lymphoma-1 cells to detect antibodies against latency-associated
     nuclear antigens (LANA) and antibodies against lytic antigens (cytoplasmic
     fluorescence). These sera exhibited differential reactivities reflecting
     different titers of antibodies against HHV-8 proteins, and variable
     reactivities were seen more commonly with the sera from HIV-/KS- adult
     men. In the Western blot assay, 89% (93 of 104) of HIV+/KS + sera, 60% (46
     of 77) of HIV+/KS- sera, and 7% (6 of 84) HIV+/KS- sera were reactive with
     both latent and lytic recombinant antigens. Western blot reactions with
     ORF 73 protein were more sensitive than LANA-IFA results. The lytic IFA
     and lytic Western blot (ORFs 65 and K8.1A) assays were more sensitive than
     the ORF 73 Western blots and LANA-IFA. With an exception of 2 sera from
     the HIV-/KS- group, all sera positive for lytic IFA antibodies and ORF 65
     and K8.1A antibodies were also positive for latent antibodies. With few
     exceptions, sera positive for ORF 65 antibodies were also positive for
     K8.1A antibodies, and sera recognized the K8.1A protein more often than
     the K8.1B protein. There is a high degree of concordance between IFA and
     Western blot reactions, suggesting that this panel of HHV-8 recombinant
     proteins could detect a majority of the HHV-8-seropositive individuals.
     These results suggest that IFA followed by confirmation with the Western
     blot reactions with a panel of latent and lytic immunogenic antigens would
     provide a reliable, sensitive, and specific method for the detection of
     HHV-8 antibodies.

TI  - Chemotaxin-dependent translocation of immunoreactive
     ADP-ribosyltransferase-1 to the surface of human neutrophil polymorphs.
PG  - 866-71
AB  - mRNA from human polymorphonuclear neutrophil leucocytes (PMNs) was probed
     with cDNA encoding human skeletal muscle arginine-specific
     ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART1). A single 2.6-kb transcript was identified,
     which was similar in size to that observed in human skeletal muscle RNA.
     An 872-bp cDNA fragment, corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the
     processed human skeletal muscle enzyme, was generated by reverse
     transcription-PCR amplification of RNA from human PMNs, and was found to
     be identical to the ART1 cDNA derived from human skeletal muscle. ART1 was
     expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in
     insect cells, and antibodies were raised against the fusion protein in a
     rabbit. Following removal of GST immunoreactivity by immunoprecipitation,
     these antibodies were used to measure the abundance of immunoreactive ART1
     on the surface of PMNs. Exposure of PMNs to formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP) was
     followed by a rapid increase in the abundance of cell surface ART1 (T1/2 =
     1.9 min), and the concentration of FMLP for half-maximum response was 28.6
     nM. Similar responses were observed after exposure of the cells to
     platelet-activating factor or interleukin-8, and we conclude that some of
     the effects of these chemotaxins are mediated by translocation of an
     intracellular pool of ART1 to its site of catalytic activity on the outer
     aspect of the plasma membrane.

TI  - A cellular protein which binds hepatitis B virus but not hepatitis B
     surface antigen.
PG  - 607-15
AB  - The envelope of hepatitis B virus (HBV) consists of three related proteins
     known as the large (L), middle (M) and small (S) hepatitis B surface
     antigens (HBsAg). L-HBsAg has a 108-119 amino acid extension at the N
     terminus compared with M-HBsAg and contains the preS1 sequence of the HBV
     envelope. Previous research has identified this region as the likely virus
     attachment protein which is thought to interact with the cellular receptor
     for the virus. However, as the receptor has still not been identified
     unequivocally, we used the preS1 region of L-HBsAg to screen a human liver
     cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system. Several positive clones were
     isolated which encoded cellular proteins that interacted with the HBV
     preS1 protein. The specificity was examined in an independent manner in
     experiments in which baculovirus-derived glutathione S-transferase
     (GST)-preS1 was incubated with 35S-labelled protein expressed by in vitro
     translation from the positive clones. The intensity of the interactions
     using this alternative approach mirrored those observed in the yeast
     two-hybrid system and two proteins (an unidentified protein and a
     mitochondrial protein) were selected for further study. The specificity of
     the binding reaction between the preS1 protein and these two proteins was
     further confirmed in a competition assay; HBV purified from serum, but not
     purified HBsAg, was able to compete with preS1 and thus block GST-preS1
     binding to the unidentified protein but not to the mitochondrial protein.
     The unidentified protein was then expressed as a fusion protein with GST
     and this was able to bind HBV virions in a direct manner.

TI  - A scintillation proximity assay for the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade:
     high-throughput screening and identification of selective enzyme
     inhibitors.
PG  - 318-29
AB  - We have developed a quantitative scintillation proximity assay (SPA) that
     reproduces the Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction pathway. The components of
     this assay include human cRaf1, MEK1, and ERK2 and a biotinylated peptide
     substrate for ERK2. cRaf1 was expressed as a his-tagged protein in insect
     cells in an active form. MEK1 and ERK2 were expressed in Escherichia coli
     as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins in their inactive
     forms. ERK2 was removed from the GST portion of the fusion protein by
     cleavage with thrombin protease. When the purified components are
     incubated together, cRaf-1 phosphorylates and activates MEK1, MEK1
     phosphorylates and activates ERK2, and ERK2 phosphorylates the peptide,
     biotin-AAATGPLSPGPFA. Phosphorylation of the peptide using [gamma-33P]ATP
     is detected following binding to streptavidin-coated SPA beads. The assay
     detects inhibitors of cRaf1, MEK1, or ERK2, and has been used to screen
     large numbers of compounds. The specific target of inhibition was
     subsequently identified with secondary assays described herein.

     alpha and regulatory beta subunits associated as an alpha2beta2
     heterotetramer. Using the two-hybrid system, we have screened a Drosophila
     embryo cDNA library for proteins that interact with DmCKII alpha. One of
     the cDNAs encodes a novel beta-like polypeptide, which we designate beta'.
     In situ hybridization localizes the corresponding gene to 56F1-2, a site
     distinct from that of both the beta gene and the Stellate family of
     beta-like sequences. The predicted sequence of beta' is more closely
     related to the beta subunit of Drosophila and other metazoans than to the
     Stellate family of proteins, suggesting that it is a second regulatory
     subunit. In vitro reconstitution studies show that a GST-beta' fusion
     protein associates with the alpha subunit to generate a tetrameric complex
     with regulatory properties similar to those of the native alpha2beta2
     holoenzyme. The data are consistent with the proposed role of the beta'
     subunit as an integral component of the holoenzyme.

     of "parallel" expression vectors.
PG  - 34-9
AB  - We describe the construction of expression vectors based on three of the
     most frequently used gene fusion affinity tags [glutathione S-transferase
     (GST), maltose binding protein (MBP), and the His6 peptide]. The
     polylinkers of pGEX4T1, pMal-c2, and a pET vector were replaced with the
     polylinker isolated from the baculovirus expression plasmid pFastBac. Once
     appropriate restriction sites have been introduced into a gene, it can be
     fused to all three affinity tags with little effort, allowing
     expression-screening experiments to be performed efficiently. We discuss
     the development and use of these vectors with respect to overcoming
     purification problems encountered for the RhoA GDP/GTP nucleotide
     dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) and their advantages over commercially
     available expression vectors.

TI  - Cyclin D1 associates with the TBP-associated factor TAF(II)250 to regulate
     Sp1-mediated transcription.
PG  - 239-47
AB  - We have previously shown that Sp1-mediated transcription is stimulated by
     Rb and repressed by cyclin D1. The stimulation of Sp1 transcriptional
     activity by Rb is conferred, in part, through a direct interaction with
     the TBP-associated factor TAF(II)250. Here we investigated the
     mechanism(s) through which cyclin D1 represses Sp1. We examined the
     ability of cyclin D1 to regulate transcription mediated by Gal4-Sp1 fusion
     proteins, which contain the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and Sp1
     trans-activation domain(s). The domain of Sp1 sufficient to confer
     repression by cyclin D1 was mapped to a region important for interaction
     with TAF(II)110. We further demonstrate that TAF(II)250-cyclin D1
     complexes can be immunoprecipitated from mammalian and
     baculovirus-infected insect cells and that recombinant GST-TAF(II)250
     (amino acids 1-434) associates with cyclin D1 in vitro. Moreover, the
     overexpression of Rb or CDK4 reduced the level of TAF(II)250-cyclin D1
     complex. The amino terminus of cyclin D1 (amino acids 1-100) was
     sufficient for association with TAF(II)250 and for repressing Sp1-mediated
     transcription. Taken together, the results suggest that cyclin D1 may
     regulate transcription by interacting directly or indirectly with
     TAF(II)250.

TI  - Identification and characterization of baxepsilon, a novel bax variant
     missing the BH2 and the transmembrane domains.
PG  - 779-85
AB  - The Bax gene is a member of the Bcl2 family that functions to regulate the
     programmed cell death process. A number of Bax isoforms have been
     previously identified: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omega. Here we
     report the identification and characterization of an additional Bax
     variant, termed Baxepsilon. The newly identified Bax variant contains a
     97-base insertion generated by alternative splicing which includes a
     previously unidentified exon between exons 4 and 5. The insertion causes
     the production of a truncated Bax protein, termed Baxepsilon, which
     encodes a protein of 164 residues with a calculated molecular weight of 18
     kDa. The last 69 amino acids of Baxalpha that encompass the BH2 and the TM
     domains are missing in Baxepsilon. The Baxepsilon protein, when expressed
     as a GST fusion protein, associated efficiently with Baxalpha, Baxepsilon,
     Bcl2, and Bcl-xL. In addition, Baxepsilon was active in inducing apoptosis
     when tested in a transient transfection assay. Furthermore, the presence
     of antiapoptotic genes including Bcl2, Bcl-xL, and baculovirus p35
     abrogated Baxepsilon and Baxalpha function. Although the newly identified
     Bax variant was detectable by RT-PCR in several normal mouse tissues, the
     role of this variant in controlling programmed cell death is currently
     unknown.

TI  - Varicella-zoster virus Fc receptor component gI is phosphorylated on its
     endodomain by a cyclin-dependent kinase.
PG  - 1320-30
AB  - Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) glycoprotein gI is a type 1 transmembrane
     glycoprotein which is one component of the heterodimeric gE:gI Fc receptor
     complex. Like VZV gE, VZV gI was phosphorylated in both VZV-infected cells
     and gI-transfected cells. Preliminary studies demonstrated that a serine
     343-proline 344 sequence located within the gI cytoplasmic tail was the
     most likely phosphorylation site. To determine which protein kinase
     catalyzed the gI phosphorylation event, we constructed a fusion protein,
     consisting of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and the gI cytoplasmic tail,
     called GST-gI-wt. When this fusion protein was used as a substrate for gI
     phosphorylation in vitro, the results demonstrated that GST-gI-wt fusion
     protein was phosphorylated by a representative cyclin-dependent kinase
     (CDK) called P-TEFb, a homologue of CDK1 (cdc2). When serine 343 within
     the serine-proline phosphorylation site was replaced with an alanine
     residue, the level of phosphorylation of the gI fusion protein was greatly
     reduced. Subsequent experiments with individually immunoprecipitated
     mammalian CDKs revealed that the VZV gI fusion protein was phosphorylated
     best by CDK1, to a lesser degree by CDK2, and not at all by CDK6.
     Transient-transfection assays carried out in the presence of the specific
     CDK inhibitor roscovitine strongly supported the prior results by
     demonstrating a marked decrease in gI phosphorylation while gI protein
     expression was unaffected. Finally, the possibility that VZV gI contained
     a CDK phosphorylation site in its endodomain was of further interest
     because its partner, gE, contains a casein kinase II phosphorylation site
     in its endodomain; prior studies have established that CDK1 can
     phosphorylate casein kinase II.

PG  - 1885-91
AB  - From a brain cDNA library of Bombyx mori, we cloned cDNA for BRab, which
     encoded a 202-amino-acid polypeptide sharing 60-80% similarity with rab1
     family members. To characterize its biochemical properties, cDNA for BRab
     was inserted into an expression vector (pGEX2T) and expressed in
     Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The
     recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity with glutathione
     S-Sepharose. The purified GST-BRab bound [35S]-GTP gamma S and [3H]-GDP
     with association constants of 1.5 x 10(6) M-1 and 0.58 x 10(6) M-1,
     respectively. The binding of [35S]-GTP gamma S was inhibited with GTP and
     GDP, but with no other nucleotides. The GTP-hydrolysis activity was
     evaluated to be 5 m mole/min/mole of BRab. In the presence of 6 mM MgCl2,
     bound [35S]-GTP gamma S and [3H]-GDP were exchanged with GTP gamma S most
     efficiently. These results suggest that BRab, having a higher affinity for
     GTP than GDP, converts from the GTP-bound state into the GDP-bound state
     by intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity and returns to the GTP-bound state
     with the exchange of GDP with GTP.

TI  - Amino acids 16-275 of minute virus of mice NS1 include a domain that
     specifically binds (ACCA)2-3-containing DNA.
PG  - 123-31
AB  - GST-NS1 purified from Escherichia coli and insect cells binds
     double-strand DNA in an (ACCA)2-3-dependent fashion under similar ionic
     conditions, independent of the presence of anti-NS1 antisera or
     exogenously supplied ATP and interacts with single-strand DNA and RNA in a
     sequence-independent manner. An amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1-275)
     of NS1 [GST-NS1(1-275)], representing 41% of the full-length NS1 molecule,
     includes a domain that binds double-strand DNA in a sequence-specific
     manner at levels comparable to full-length GST-NS1, as well as
     single-strand DNA and RNA in a sequence-independent manner. The deletion
     of 15 additional amino-terminal amino acids yielded a molecule
     [GST-NS1(1-275)] that maintained (ACCA)2-3-specific double-strand DNA
     binding; however, this molecule was more sensitive to increasing ionic
     conditions than full-length GST-NS1 and GST-NS1(1-275) and could not be
     demonstrated to bind single-strand nucleic acids. A quantitative filter
     binding assay showed that E. coli- and baculovirus-expressed GST-NS1 and
     E. coli GST-NS1(1-275) specifically bound double-strand DNA with similar
     equilibrium kinetics [as measured by their apparent equilibrium DNA
     binding constants (KD)], whereas GST-NS1(16-275) bound 4- to 8-fold less
     well.

AB  - The reduction of the tetrazolium salt
     3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a
     blue formazan product is widely used for assaying cell survival and
     proliferation. The reduction reaction is catalyzed by dehydrogenases
     localized in the mitochondria of viable cells. As part of an analysis of
     the ability of glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes to protect cells
     from electrophilic compounds, we found extremely high background levels of
     the formazan product produced by cells that overexpressed the mouse GST
     P1-1 enzyme. Further analysis with purified GST enzymes confirmed the
     ability of these enzymes to reduce MTT in vitro. These data suggest that
     cytotoxicity assays using MTT should be interpreted with caution,
     especially when studying the effects of compounds that can influence GST
     expression.

TI  - Interaction of insulin receptor substrate-1 with the sigma3A subunit of

PG  - 29942-9
AB  - Signaling through the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase involves its
     autophosphorylation in response to insulin and the subsequent tyrosine
     phosphorylation of substrate proteins such as insulin receptor substrate-1
     (IRS-1). In basal 3T3-L1 adipocytes, IRS-1 is predominantly
     membrane-bound, and this localization may be important in targeting
     downstream signaling elements that mediate insulin action. Since IRS-1
     localization to membranes may occur through its association with specific
     membrane proteins, a 3T3-F442A adipocyte cDNA expression library was
     screened with non-tyrosine-phosphorylated, baculovirus-expressed IRS-1 in
     order to identify potential IRS-1 receptors. A cDNA clone that encodes
     sigma3A, a small subunit of the AP-3 adaptor protein complex, was
     demonstrated to bind IRS-1 utilizing this cloning strategy. The specific
     interaction between IRS-1 and sigma3A was further verified by in vitro
     binding studies employing baculovirus-expressed IRS-1 and a glutathione
     S-transferase (GST)-sigma3A fusion protein. IRS-1 and sigma3A were found
     to co-fractionate in a detergent-resistant population of low density
     membranes isolated from basal 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Importantly, the addition
     of exogenous purified GST-sigma3A to low density membranes caused the
     release of virtually all of the IRS-1 bound to these membranes, while GST
     alone had no effect. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
     sigma3A serves as an IRS-1 receptor that may dictate the subcellular
     localization and the signaling functions of IRS-1.

TI  - GST-Induced dimerization of DNA-binding domains alters characteristics of
     their interaction with DNA.
PG  - 208-20
AB  - The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) plays a key role in the
     induction and modulation of morphogenetic events throughout Drosophila
     melanogaster development. Two members of the nuclear receptor superfamily,
     the product of the EcR (EcR) and of the ultraspiracle genes (Usp),
     heterodimerize to form its functional receptor. To study the receptor-DNA
     interaction, critical for regulating 20E-dependent gene expression, it is
     necessary to produce large quantities of EcR and Usp DNA-binding domains.
     Toward this end DNA-binding domains of EcR and Usp (EcRDBD and UspDBD,
     respectively) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion
     proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). However, the results of
     DNA-binding studies obtained with purified GST-DBDs were found to be
     questionable because the fused proteins oligomerized in solution due to
     the presence of GST. Therefore DBDs were released from GST-chimeric
     proteins by thrombin cleavage and then purified by glutathione-Sepharose
     4B chromatography and by gel filtration on Superdex 75 HR. The gel
     mobility-shift experiments showed that UspDBD exhibited higher affinity
     than EcRDBD toward a 20-hydroxyecdysone response element from the
     Drosophila hsp 27 gene (hsp 27pal). Furthermore, formation of the
     heterodimeric EcRDBD-UspDBD complex was observed to be synergistic when
     equimolar mixture of both DBDs was incubated with hsp 27pal. Surprisingly,
     GST-EcRDBD bound hsp 27pal with higher affinity than GST-UspDBD. This
     difference was accompanied by the impaired ability of the GST-DBDs to
     interact synergistically with hsp 27pal. This is the first report on
     expression and purification of the soluble DBDs of the functional
     ecdysteroid receptor with satisfying yields. Furthermore, our results add
     to the recent findings which indicate the need for caution in interpreting
     the activities of GST fusion proteins.

PG  - 157-65
AB  - We have expressed the E1 protein of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in a new
     recombinant form by using a baculovirus transfer vector directing the
     expression of proteins fused to the carboxy-terminus of
     glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The E1 domain was expressed varying at
     its carboxy terminus in order to retain (GST-E1) or delete (GST-E1b) the
     C-terminal hydrophobic region that may be involved in membrane
     association. Following infection with the recombinant virus, GST-E1b was
     efficiently secreted into the culture media and could be purified in a
     single step with the minimum of denaturation by glutathione affinity
     chromatography. The purified product was specifically immunoprecipitated
     by HCV positive human sera suggesting the maintenance of an
     immuno-relevant tertiary structure despite removal of the hydrophobic
     anchor. By contrast, cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus
     expressing GST-E1 gave a fusion protein with an appropriate molecular
     weight but also a series of polypeptides of lower molecular weight
     consistent with cleavage at the C-terminus of E1. GST-E1 was not secreted
     into the medium and was associated predominantly with the membrane
     fraction following cell disruption; the lower molecular weight forms were
     soluble and secreted.

     California isolate (BYV-CA), were sequenced and the expression of the

     for p24) was most conserved compared with ORF 7 (coding for p20) and ORF 8
     (coding for p21) among the isolates analyzed. Polyclonal antisera were
     produced to GST fusion proteins of p24, p20, and p21. Accumulation of p24,
     CP, p20 and p21 was studied in infected Tetragonia expansa plants and
     Chenopodium quinoa protoplasts. All four proteins were expressed in all
     tissues (old leaves, young leaves and stems), and most abundantly in young
     leaves. The subcellular localization of each protein in different tissues
     showed that compared with p24, CP and p21, p20 accumulated less in
     transfected protoplasts. Immunogold labeling in sugarbeet with p24 and CP
     antisera demonstrated co-localization of p24 and CP in vascular petiole
     tissues. In infectivity neutralization tests, antisera against p24 and CP
     greatly reduced transmission of BYV by viruliferous aphids compared with
     viruliferous aphids fed on preimmune serum or antiserum to p21.

TI  - Insulin stimulates pp120 endocytosis in cells co-expressing insulin
     receptors.
PG  - 22194-200
AB  - pp120, a substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, is a plasma
     membrane glycoprotein that is expressed in the hepatocyte as two spliced
     isoforms differing by the presence (full-length) or absence (truncated) of
     most of the intracellular domain including all phosphorylation sites.
     Co-expression of full-length pp120, but not its phosphorylation-defective
     isoforms, increased receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis and degradation
     in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. We, herein, examined whether internalization of
     pp120 is required to mediate its effect on insulin endocytosis. The amount
     of full-length pp120 expressed at the cell surface membrane, as measured
     by biotin labeling, markedly decreased in response to insulin only when
     insulin receptors were co-expressed. In contrast, when
     phosphorylation-defective pp120 mutants were co-expressed, the amount of
     pp120 expressed at the cell surface did not decrease in response to
     insulin. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis revealed that upon insulin
     treatment of cells co-expressing insulin receptors, full-length, but not
     truncated, pp120 co-localized with alpha-adaptin in the adaptor protein
     complex that anchors endocytosed proteins to clathrin-coated pits. This
     suggests that full-length pp120 is part of a complex of proteins required
     for receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis and that formation of this
     complex is regulated by insulin-induced pp120 phosphorylation by the
     receptor tyrosine kinase. In vitro GST binding assays and
     co-immunoprecipitation experiments in intact cells further revealed that
     pp120 did not bind directly to the insulin receptor and that its
     association with the receptor may be mediated by other cellular proteins.

     This cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase
     fusion protein. Mature hypodermin C was released from the GST-fusion after
     glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography and proteolytic cleavage
     using factor Xa. The purified recombinant protein showed enzymatic
     activity in gelatin-polyacrylamide gels and when azocoll was used as
     substrate. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed using the
     recombinant antigen. Positive/negative cutoff values were calculated using
     the mean OD percentage (1.74%) of 113 negative sera plus three standard
     deviations. Sensitivity and specificity according to the resulting cutoff
     (10.74%) were 85 and 98.2% respectively.

     the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) for the
     presentation of foreign proteins on the virus surface.
PG  - 1079-84
AB  - We describe the development of the baculovirus Autographa californica
     nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) as a vector for the display of distinct
     proteins on the viral surface in a manner that is analogous to the
     established bacterial "phage display" systems. As a model system, the
     marker gene encoding the 26kDa protein glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was
     used to construct several fusions with the major baculovirus glycoprotein
     gp64 gene. Following expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells, the
     yield and cellular distribution of each GST-gp64 protein was assessed by
     Western blot of both cell and supernatant fractions. One fusion, in which
     GST was inserted between the leader peptide and the nature protein, was
     found to be efficiently secreted into the cell medium. In the context of
     expression of the full length gp64, the hybrid GST-gp64 was shown by
     immunogold labelling to be incorporated onto the virion surface. In
     addition, the affinity purification of the soluble transmembrane gp64-GST
     fusion protein resulted in the co-purification of wild type gp64
     suggesting that co-oligomerization of the GST-tagged fusion and the wild
     type molecule was the basis for virion incorporation. The HIV major
     surface glycoprotein, gp120 was also efficiently displayed in functional
     form on the viral surface following fusion to the amino terminus of gp64.
     A general expression vector, pAcSurf-2, was constructed in which multiple
     cloning sites were positioned in-phase between the gp64 signal sequence
     and the sequence encoding the mature protein under the control of the
     polyhedrin promoter.

TI  - Development and characterization of monoclonal antibodies specific to the
     serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.
PG  - 811-24
AB  - Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) mediates many functions of the
     central and peripheral nervous systems by its interaction with specific
     neuronal and glial receptors. Fourteen serotonin receptors belonging to
     seven families have been identified through physiological,
     pharmacological, and molecular cloning studies. Monoclonal antibodies
     (MAbs) specific for each of these receptor subtypes are needed to
     characterize their expression, distribution, and function in embryonic,
     adult, and pathological tissues. In this article we report the development
     and characterization of MAbs specific to the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. To
     generate MAbs against 5-HT2AR, mice were immunized with the N-terminal
     domain of the receptor. The antigens were produced as glutathionine
     S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in insect cells using a Baculovirus
     expression system. The hybridomas were initially screened by ELISA against
     the GST-5-HT2AR recombinant proteins and subsequently against GST control
     proteins to eliminate clones with unwanted reactivity. They were further
     tested by Western blotting against recombinant GST-5-HT2AR, rat and human
     brain lysate, and lysate from cell lines transfected with 5-HT2AR cDNA.
     One of the MAbs G186-1117, which recognizes a portion of the 5-HT2AR
     N-terminus, was selected for further characterization. G186-1117 reacted
     with a band of molecular size 55 kD corresponding to the predicted size of
     5-HT2AR in lysates from rat brain and a 5-HT2AR-transfected cell line. Its
     specificity was further confirmed by adsorption of immunoreactivity with
     recombinant 5-HT2AR but not with recombinant 5-HT2BR and 5-HT2CR. Rat
     brain sections and Schwann cell cultures were immunohistochemically
     labeled with this MAb. G186-1117 showed differential staining in various
     regions of the rat brain, varying from regions with no staining to regions
     of intense reactivity. In particular, staining of cell bodies and
     dendrites of the pyramidal neurons in the cortex was observed, which is in
     agreement with observations of electrophysiological studies.

     from Sitophilus zeamais (SCPs) cloned in our previous study [Matsumoto et
     al. (1997) J. Biochem. 121, 464-476], we established a system for their
     functional expression and purification using a glutathione S-transferase
     (GST) fusion gene vector from Escherichia coli. The proenzyme forms of two
     representative SCPs, proSCPc1 and proSCPg3, were expressed as GST-fusion
     proteins and purified on a glutathione Sepharose column. GST-proSCPc1
     undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage into the mature form efficiently at
     acidic pH, and exhibits significant proteolytic activity toward various
     substrates including hemoglobin and Z-Phe-Arg-MCA. The enzymatic
     characteristics of the activated form of SCPc1 are similar to those of
     mammalian cathepsin L, but its pH optimum for the hydrolysis of hemoglobin
     is significantly lower. The other proSCP, GST-proSCPg3, which has a
     shorter COOH-terminal domain than SCPc1, undergoes almost no autolytic
     processing and shows only very slight proteolytic activity, although the
     other enzymatic characteristics of GST-proSCPg3 are similar to those of
     GST-proSCPc1.

     isolation of cDNA by differential display, expression of the active
     enzyme, and regulation of TNF-alpha.
PG  - 4570-9
AB  - A snake venom-like protease isolated by a differential display screen
     between normal and osteoarthritis (OA)-affected cartilage (designated as
     cSVP) has a cDNA sequence identical to TNF-alpha convertase enzyme (TACE).
     TACE shows the presence of an unknown prodomain, a cysteine switch, a
     catalytic domain, a zinc binding region, a disintegrin region, an EGF-like
     domain, a transmembrane domain, and a unique cytoplasmic region. A TACE
     construct harboring the signal + prodomain + catalytic region
     (TACE-SPCdeltaDETCy), expressed in baculovirus could cleave preferentially
     (approximately 12-fold) the TNF-specific peptide over the matrix
     metalloproteases peptide in vitro. This recombinant protein also cleaved
     the natural substrate GST-ProTNF-alpha to TNF-alpha (17 kDa) in vitro. The
     mRNA for TACE, which is broadly distributed and differentially expressed
     in a variety of human tissues, is up-regulated in arthritis-affected
     cartilage, but not normal cartilage. OA-affected cartilage also expressed
     TNF-alpha mRNA that was not detected in normal cartilage. The OA-affected
     cartilage (in explant assays) spontaneously released TNF-alpha and IL-8 in
     ex vivo conditions. Addition of TNF-alphaR fused to IgG Fc fragment
     (TNF-alphaR:Fc) in the presence or absence of soluble IL-1R (with which it
     acted additively) significantly attenuated the spontaneous/autocrine
     release of articular IL-8 in this assay. These experiments demonstrate a
     functional paracrine/autocrine role of TNF-alpha in OA-affected cartilage
     that may depend, in part, on up-regulated levels of chondrocyte-derived
     TACE.

TI  - Interaction of troponin-H and glutathione S-transferase-2 in the indirect
     flight muscles of Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 117-27
AB  - Drosophila indirect flight muscles (IFMs) contain a 35 kDa protein which
     cross-reacts with antibodies to the IFM specific protein troponin-H
     isoform 34 (TnH-34). Peptide fingerprinting and peptide sequencing showed
     that this 35 kDa protein is glutathione S-transferase-2 (GST-2). GST-2 is
     present in the asynchronous indirect flight muscles but not in the
     synchronous tergal depressor of the trochanter (jump muscle). Genetic
     dissection of the sarcomere showed that GST-2 is stably associated with
     the thin filaments but the presence of myosin is required to achieve the
     correct stoichiometry, suggesting that there is also an interaction with
     the thick filament. The two Drosophila TnHs (isoforms 33 and 34) are
     naturally occurring fusion proteins in which a proline-rich extension of
     approximately 250 amino acids replaces the 27 C-terminal residues of the
     muscle-specific tropomyosin II isoform. The proteolytic enzyme, Igase,
     cleaves the hydrophobic C-terminal sequence of TnH-34 at three sites and
     TnH-33 at one site. This results in the release of GST-2 from the
     myofibril. The amount of GST-2 stably bound to the myofibril is directly
     proportional to the total amount of undigested TnH. It is concluded that
     GST-2 in the thin filament is stabilized there by interaction with TnH. We
     speculate that the hydrophobic N-terminal region of GST-2 interacts with
     the hydrophobic C-terminal extension of TnH, and that both are close to a
     myosin cross-bridge.

TI  - Regulation of the p85/p110 phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase: stabilization
     and inhibition of the p110alpha catalytic subunit by the p85 regulatory
     subunit.
PG  - 1379-87
AB  - We propose a novel model for the regulation of the p85/pl10alpha
     phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase. In insect cells, the p110alpha catalytic
     subunit is active as a monomer but its activity is decreased by
     coexpression with the p85 regulatory subunit. Similarly, the lipid kinase
     activity of recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p110alpha is
     reduced by 65 to 85% upon in vitro reconstitution with p85. Incubation of
     p110alpha/p85 dimers with phosphotyrosyl peptides restored activity, but
     only to the level of monomeric p110alpha. These data show that the binding
     of phosphoproteins to the SH2 domains of p85 activates the p85/p110alpha
     dimers by inducing a transition from an inhibited to a disinhibited state.
     In contrast, monomeric p110 had little activity in HEK 293T cells, and its
     activity was increased 15- to 20-fold by coexpression with p85. However,
     this apparent requirement for p85 was eliminated by the addition of a
     bulky tag to the N terminus of p110alpha or by the growth of the HEK 293T
     cells at 30 degrees C. These nonspecific interventions mimicked the
     effects of p85 on p110alpha, suggesting that the regulatory subunit acts
     by stabilizing the overall conformation of the catalytic subunit rather
     than by inducing a specific activated conformation. This stabilization was
     directly demonstrated in metabolically labeled HEK 293T cells, in which
     p85 increased the half-life of p110. Furthermore, p85 protected p110 from
     thermal inactivation in vitro. Importantly, when we examined the effect of
     p85 on GST-p110alpha in mammalian cells at 30 degrees C, culture
     conditions that stabilize the catalytic subunit and that are similar to
     the conditions used for insect cells, we found that p85 inhibited
     p110alpha. Thus, we have experimentally distinguished two effects of p85
     on p110alpha: conformational stabilization of the catalytic subunit and
     inhibition of its lipid kinase activity. Our data reconcile the apparent
     conflict between previous studies of insect versus mammalian cells and
     show that p110alpha is both stabilized and inhibited by dimerization with
     p85.

AB  - Interactions between the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) origin
     (ori)-binding protein (UL9) and two other components of the functional DNA
     replication complex have been observed. However, to date, no interaction
     between UL9 and a component of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme has been
     demonstrated. In this report, we demonstrate that UL9 and the DNA
     polymerase accessory protein (UL42) can form a stable complex in vitro as
     determined by coimmunoprecipitation with specific antibodies to each
     protein and by affinity chromatography using glutathione S-transferase
     (GST) fusion proteins. Complex formation does not require the presence of
     other viral proteins and occurs in the presence of ethidium bromide,
     indicating that UL9-UL42 interaction is DNA independent. Affinity beads
     charged with increasing concentrations of GST-42 fusion protein up to 5
     microM bound increasing amounts of UL9 expressed by in vitro
     transcription/translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Binding of N-
     and C-terminal portions of UL9 to GST affinity matrices revealed that the
     N-terminal 533 amino acids were sufficient for binding to GST-42, albeit
     at approximately a four- to six-fold reduced affinity compared to the
     full-length protein. No binding of a polypeptide containing the remainder
     of the UL9 C-terminal residues was observed. Thus the ori-binding protein,
     UL9, can physically associate with at least one member of each of the
     complexes (helicase/primase, DNA polymerase holoenzyme, single-stranded
     DNA-binding protein) required for origin-dependent DNA replication. These
     specific interactions provide a means by which the ordered assembly of
     HSV-1 DNA replication proteins at origins of replication can occur in the
     infected cell for initiation of viral DNA synthesis.

TI  - A complex glutathione transferase gene family in the housefly Musca
     domestica.
PG  - 187-94
AB  - In most metazoans, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) are encoded by
     gene families, and are used to detoxify xenobiotics. We describe the
     structure of genomic loci coding for the GSTs in the housefly that have
     been implicated, by both genetic and biochemical means, in mediating
     insecticide resistance. In earlier work, we showed that one of the
     theta-class enzymes, MdGST-3, is overproduced in resistant flies and
     degrades certain insecticides. We used a fragment from a cDNA clone of
     MdGST-3 as a probe to screen a housefly genomic DNA bank in phage lambda.
     This probe detected multiple gst loci. Genes for GSTs were found in five
     different, nonoverlapping lambda clones, three of which carry multiple,
     closely linked gsts. Multiple genes for both MdGST-3 and MdGST-4 were
     found; some of which have introns in their 5' untranslated regions. In
     adults, the only MdGST-3 enzymes that are expressed are encoded by the
     intron-free genes. A new theta-class GST (called MdGST-5) was also
     discovered. Fusion genes comprising 5' MdGST-3 sequences and either
     MdGST-4 or MdGST-5 sequences in their 3' halves were encountered at three
     separate loci. The genes described here are found in both the ancestral
     sensitive strain and the insecticide-resistant strains.

PG  - 267-74
AB  - The kinetic mechanism of the trk receptor-linked tyrosine kinase was
     determined using a baculovirus expressed trk kinase domain and a
     bacterially expressed phospholipase C-gamma/glutathione S-transferase
     (PLC-gamma/ GST) fusion protein as substrate. Product and dead-end
     inhibition studies indicate an ordered association of substrates to trkA
     kinase with the nucleotide ATP binding prior to the exogenous substrate
     PLC-gamma/GST, followed by release of the phosphorylated PLC-gamma/GST
     product prior to release of ADP (sequential ordered bi-bi mechanism). This
     is in contrast to the reported kinetic mechanisms of closely related EGF
     receptor and insulin receptor kinases which appear to proceed via a rapid
     equilibrium random mechanism. The indolocarbazole K-252a, which was
     previously shown to be a potent and relatively selective inhibitor of trk
     kinase activity, acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP. The
     data suggest that potent and selective kinase inhibitors can be rationally
     designed by exploring subtle variations surrounding the nucleotide binding
     sites of receptor tyrosine kinases.

TI  - The immunophilin FKBP65 forms an association with the serine/threonine
     kinase c-Raf-1.
PG  - 41-8
AB  - FKBP65 is a member of the FK506-binding protein class of immunophilins and
     is the only member reported to contain four peptidylprolyl cis-trans
     isomerase domains and an unrelated COOH-terminal domain. In this report,
     we show that the heat shock protein hsp90 and the serine/threonine protein
     kinase c-Raf-1 are components of FKBP65 immune complexes. The NH2-terminal
     regulatory domain of c-Raf-1 appears to be required for its interaction
     with FKBP65. Using GST-FKBP65 fusion protein and purified Raf proteins, we
     show that full-length FKBP65 can interact with c-Raf-1 but not B-Raf. The
     activation kinetics of c-Raf-1 after v-H-RasV12 injection of Xenopus
     oocytes appear to correlate with FKBP65/c-Raf-1 interaction, suggesting
     that FKBP65 may preferentially associate with forms of c-Raf-1 that are
     more posttranslationally modified. The interaction of FKBP65 with the
     c-Raf-heat shock protein 90 heterocomplex implicates this immunophilin in
     signal-transduction processes.

TI  - Identification of endogenous substrates for Drosophila calpain from a
     salt-extracted fraction of Drosophila ovaries.
PG  - 865-71
AB  - Drosophila calpain (Dm-calpain) produced in Escherichia coli has a
     distinct Ca2+-dependent activity. By using a recombinant Dm-calpain, we
     searched for its substrates occurring in Drosophila ovaries, where
     Dm-calpain is expressed. Among a number of major proteins, several
     proteins in a salt-extracted fraction were selectively degraded by
     Dm-calpain in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The major substrates were
     identified by microsequencing the lysylendopeptidase-digested proteins.
     Three ribosomal proteins, the L5, L7, and L8 subunits of the 60S ribosome,
     were found to be potential Dm-calpain substrates. In addition, the alpha
     subunit of elongation factor-1 (EF-1alpha), a multi-functional protein
     involved in both protein synthesis and cytoskeletal regulation, was shown
     to be cleaved by Dm-calpain into several distinct fragments when expressed
     as a GST-fusion protein. Endogenous EF-1alpha in ovary extracts was also
     shown by western blot analysis to be similarly degraded. These
     observations suggest that Dm-calpain may regulate protein synthesis and
     cytoskeletal structure through its degradative or processing activity.

AB  - A gene expression system using recombinant Autographa california nuclear
     polyhedrosis virus (baculovirus) and Sf-9 cells has been scaled up to the
     10-L tank level and shown to be capable of producing herpes simplex virus
     (HSV) protease in serum-free media. High densities of Spodoptera
     frugiperda (Sf-9) cells were achieved by modifying two 10-L Biolafitte
     fermenters specifically for insect cell growth. The existing Rushton
     impellers were replaced by marine impellers to reduce shear and the
     aeration system was modified to allow external addition of air/O2 mixtures
     at low flow rates through either the sparge line or into the head space of
     the fermenter. To inoculate the tanks, Sf-9 cells were adapted to grow to
     high cell densities (6-10 x 10(6) cells ml-1) in shake flasks in
     serum-free media. With these procedures, cell densities of 5 x 10(6) cells
     ml-1 were routinely achieved in the 10-L tanks. These cells were readily
     infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing the 247-amino acid
     catalytic domain of the HSV-1 strain 17 protease UL26 gene as a
     glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (GST-247). Three days after
     infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 pfu cell-1, the
     GST-247 fusion protein was purified from a cytoplasmic lysate by
     Glutathione Sepharose 4-B affinity chromatography with reproducible yields
     of 11-38 mg L-1 of recombinant protein and > or = 90% purity. Maximum
     production of this protein was observed at a cell density of 5.0 x 10(6)
     cells ml-1.

     465*-mediated cell death.
PG  - 25873-80
AB  - Previously we have shown that ICR-27, a clone of glucocorticoid-resistant
     human leukemic T cells, showed rapid cell loss upon transient transfection
     with plasmids expressing certain fragments of the human glucocorticoid
     receptor lacking the ligand binding domain. An extreme example was the
     frameshift GR mutant 465*, mutated after amino acid 465. This generated a
     novel 21-amino acid "tail," beginning within the second zinc finger of the
     human glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain, a region required for
     ICR-27 cell death caused by hologlucocorticoid receptor plus hormone. The
     cell loss mediated by 465* was faster but quantitatively equivalent to
     that caused by hologlucocorticoid receptor plus hormone. We are therefore
     investigating the mechanism of action of 465*. We overexpressed 465* with
     or without a glutathione S-transferase tag fused to its N terminus and
     tested its ability to affect glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-driven
     reactions in vitro. Partially purified 465* showed little binding to a
     consensus GRE, caused virtually no stimulation of transcription from a
     GRE, and failed to inhibit GR-driven transcription. However, GST-465*
     "trapped" several proteins from ICR-27 cell extracts, including c-Jun;
     recombinant c-Jun also was bound in vitro. In co-transfection assays of
     CV-1 cells, 465* expression reduced phorbol ester
     (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) transcriptional activation from a
     promoter containing multiple AP-1 sites. Further studies proved the
     repressive activity of 465* was c-Jun-specific and not due to squelching
     artifacts. The data suggest that interaction of 465* with other proteins,
     such as c-Jun, might be responsible for its cell killing function.

TI  - Distinct roles of E2F recognition sites as positive or negative elements
     in regulation of the DNA polymerase alpha 180 kDa catalytic subunit gene
     promoter during Drosophila development.
PG  - 3847-54
AB  - The transcription factor E2F plays a key role in transcriptional control
     during the growth cycle of higher eukaryotic cells. The promoter region of
     the DrosophilaDNA polymerase alpha 180 kDa catalytic subunit gene contains
     three E2F recognition sequences located at positions -353 to -342 (E2F
     site 1), -21 to -14 (E2F site 2) and -12 to -5 (E2F site 3) with respect
     to the transcription initiation site. Various base substitutions were
     generated in each or all of the three E2F sites in vitro to allow
     examination of their effects on E2F binding and promoter function in
     cultured Kc cells as well as in living flies. Glutathione S-transferase
     (GST)-E2F and GST-DP fusion proteins were found to cooperate in binding to
     the three E2F sites in the DNA polymerase alpha gene promoter in vitro. In
     contrast, an E2F-specific activity detected in nuclear extracts of Kc
     cells showed little affinity for E2F site 1 but strong binding to sites 2
     and 3. Transient expression of Drosophila E2F in Kc cells activated the
     DNA polymerase alpha gene promoter and the target sites for activation
     coincided with E2F sites 2 and 3. However, analyses with transgenic flies
     indicate that E2F site 3 functions positively in terms of DNA polymerase
     alpha gene promoter activity, while E2F sites 1 and 2 rather have a
     negative control function. Thus E2F sites play distinct roles as positive
     or negative elements in regulation of the DNA polymerase alpha gene
     promoter during Drosophila development.

PG  - 7328-36
AB  - The herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infected-cell protein 0 (ICP0) has the
     characteristics of a promiscuous transactivator of genes introduced into
     cells by infection or transfection. To identify cellular proteins
     interacting with ICP0, we used a domain of exon II of ICP0 that is known
     to be crucial for regulatory function of the protein as bait in the yeast
     two-hybrid screen. Our results were as follows. (i) A cDNA in a positive
     yeast colony was found to encode cyclin D3, a cell cycle regulator of G1
     phase. (ii) A purified chimeric protein consisting of glutathione
     S-transferase (GST) fused to cyclin D3 specifically formed complexes with
     ICP0 contained in HSV-1-infected cell lysate. (iii) To enhance the
     expression of cyclin D3, the gene was inserted into the viral genome and
     overexpressed in infected cells. The overexpressed cyclin D3 colocalized
     with ICP0 in nuclear structures characteristic of ND10 and which earlier
     have been reported to contain ICP0. (iv) The accumulation of cyclin D3
     protein in Vero cells infected with an alpha0 deletion mutant was reduced
     relative to that of cells infected with wild-type virus or a recombinant
     virus in which the deleted alpha0 sequences were restored. (v) Lysates of
     Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells doubly infected with baculoviruses
     genetically engineered to express cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4
     (CDK4) phosphorylated GST fused to retinoblastoma protein (GST-pRb) but
     did not phosphorylate the GST-alpha0(20-241) or GST-alpha0(543-768) fusion
     protein or immunoprecipitated ICP0 proteins. Moreover, the chimeric
     GST-ICP0(exon II) protein shown to bind cyclin D3 had no effect on the
     activity of the kinase on GST-pRb when added to mixtures of lysates of Sf9
     cells which coexpressed cyclin D3 and CDK4. These results indicate that
     ICP0 interacts with, colocalizes with, and stabilizes the cyclin D3 cell
     cycle regulator and does not affect its interaction with the
     cyclin-dependent kinase.

TI  - Role of histone tails in nucleosome remodeling by Drosophila NURF.
PG  - 4717-26
AB  - The Drosophila nucleosome remodeling factor NURF utilizes the energy of
     ATP hydrolysis to perturb the structure of nucleosomes and facilitate
     binding of transcription factors. The ATPase activity of purified NURF is
     stimulated significantly more by nucleosomes than by naked DNA or histones
     alone, suggesting that NURF is able to recognize specific features of the
     nucleosome. Here, we show that the interaction between NURF and
     nucleosomes is impaired by proteolytic removal of the N-terminal histone
     tails and by chemical cross-linking of nucleosomal histones. The ATPase
     activity of NURF is also competitively inhibited by each of the four
     Drosophila histone tails expressed as GST fusion proteins. A similar
     inhibition is observed for a histone H4 tail substituted with glutamine at
     four conserved, acetylatable lysines. These findings indicate a novel role
     for the flexible histone tails in chromatin remodeling by NURF, and this
     role may, in part, be independent of histone acetylation.

TI  - Direct interaction of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase and caveolin-1
     inhibits synthase activity.
PG  - 18522-5
AB  - Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and caveolin-1 are associated
     within endothelial plasmalemmal caveolae. It is not known, however,
     whether eNOS and caveolin-1 interact directly or indirectly or whether the
     interaction affects eNOS activity. To answer these questions, we have
     cloned the bovine caveolin-1 cDNA and have investigated the
     eNOS-caveolin-1 interaction in an in vitro binding assay system using
     glutathione S-transferase (GST)-caveolin-1 fusion proteins and
     baculovirus-expressed bovine eNOS. We have also mapped the domains
     involved in the interaction using an in vivo yeast two-hybrid system.
     Results obtained using both in vitro and in vivo protein interaction
     assays show that both N- and C-terminal cytosolic domains of caveolin-1
     interact directly with the eNOS oxygenase domain. Interaction of eNOS with
     GST-caveolin-1 fusion proteins significantly inhibits enzyme catalytic
     activity. A synthetic peptide corresponding to caveolin-1 residues 82-101
     also potently and reversibly inhibits eNOS activity by interfering with
     the interaction of the enzyme with Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM). Regulation of
     eNOS in endothelial cells, therefore, may involve not only positive
     allosteric regulation by Ca2+/CaM, but also negative allosteric regulation
     by caveolin-1.

     kinase from baculovirus-infected insect cells.
PG  - 263-74
AB  - An activated form of the human cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory
     drug-binding protein 2 (CSBP2) kinase was expressed in Spodoptera
     frugiperda (SF9) cells from a baculovirus vector. To maximize expression
     and to facilitate purification of the recombinant protein, CSBP2 kinase
     was expressed as a carboxy-terminal fusion protein to glutathione
     S-transferase (GST). Under optimal conditions, 2-3 mg of GST-CSBP2 could
     be obtained per liter of infected cell culture. The fusion protein was
     easily purified from the soluble fraction of the total cell lysate under
     nondenaturing conditions by using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity
     resin. As expected, the purified GST-CSBP2 fusion protein was
     approximately 68 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl
     sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and reacted with
     antibodies directed toward either the GST or the CSBP amino terminus. To
     obtain activated CSBP2, SF9 cells were coinfected with two recombinant
     baculovirus vectors: one that directed the synthesis of the GST-CSBP2
     fusion protein and a second vector that directed the synthesis of a
     constitutively active form of the CSBP activating kinase, MKK3.
     Coexpression of GST-CSBP2 kinase with the MKK3 activator increased
     GST-CSBP2 activity 8- to 10-fold based on the ability of GST-CSBP2 to
     phosphorylate the substrate, myelin basic protein (MBP), and the ATF2
     transcription factor, in vitro. Moreover, activated GST-CSBP2 was capable
     of activating a bacterially derived mitogen-activated protein
     kinase-activating protein kinase 2 in vitro. The activity of
     insect-derived GST-CSBP2 was also inhibited by the CSBP inhibitor,
     SB202190. We anticipate that the preparation and purification techniques
     described in this study will facilitate further biochemical
     characterization of this kinase.

     whose synthesis is subject to both carbon and nitrogen repression. The pr1
     promoter region was sequenced revealing the presence of putative CREA- and
     AREA-binding sites. In vitro bandshift experiments demonstrated that an
     Aspergillus nidulans GST-CREA fusion protein was capable of binding to two
     of the three putative CREA sites. Using a PCR-based strategy the M.
     anisopliae crr1 gene was identified; it encodes a putative C2H2-type
     DNA-binding protein with significant sequence similarity to A. nidulans
     CREA. Complementation experiments with an A. nidulans strain carrying
     creA204 demonstrated that CRR1 can partially substitute for CREA function.

PG  - 2395-406
AB  - P130 shares structural and functional homology with pRb and p107. One
     property common to p107 and p130, but not to pRb, is the ability to stably
     interact with cyclin A/cdk2 and cyclin E/cdk2 complexes in vitro and in
     vivo. Using GST-p130 fusion proteins representing various regions of p130,
     baculovirus-produced cyclin A/cdk2 and cyclin E/cdk2 complexes were found
     to interact with residues within a part of p130 known as the spacer
     region. Cyclin E was able to bind the p130 spacer region in the presence
     or absence of cdk2 whereas cyclin A binding was dependent upon the
     presence of cdk2. The smallest p130 fusion protein sufficient to interact
     with cyclin A/cdk2 or cyclin E/cdk2 complexes contained p130 amino acids
     652-698 and deletion of p130 amino acids 680-682 abolished binding to both
     of the cyclin/cdk2 complexes. When overexpressed in C33A cells, a p130
     mutant containing a deletion of amino acids 620-697 was unable to form
     complexes with either cyclin A or cyclin E. This p130 mutant was at least
     as active as wild type p130 in suppressing the growth of G418 resistant
     colonies when overexpressed in C33A or SAOS-2 cells.

TI  - Interactions of Drosophila Cbl with epidermal growth factor receptors and
     role of Cbl in R7 photoreceptor cell development.
PG  - 2217-25
AB  - The human proto-oncogene product c-Cbl and a similar protein in
     Caenorhabditis elegans (Sli-1) contain a proline-rich COOH-terminal region
     that binds Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of proteins such as the adapter
     Grb2. Cb1-Grb2 complexes can be recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated
     epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors through the SH2 domain of Grb2.
     Here we identify by molecular cloning a Drosophila cDNA encoding a protein
     (Drosophila Cbl [D-Cbl]) that shows high sequence similarity to the
     N-terminal region of human c-Cbl but lacks proline-rich sequences and
     fails to bind Grb2. Nonetheless, in COS-1 cells, expression of
     hemagglutinin epitope-tagged D-Cbl results in its coimmunoprecipitation
     with EGF receptors in response to EGF. EGF also caused tyrosine
     phosphorylation of D-Cbl in such cells, but no association of
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was detected in assays using anti-p85
     antibody. A point mutation in D-Cbl (G305E) that suppresses the negative
     regulation of LET-23 by the Cbl homolog Sli-1 in C. elegans prevented
     tyrosine phosphorylation of D-Cbl as well as binding to the liganded EGF
     receptor in COS-1 cells. Colocalization of EGF receptors with both
     endogenous c-Cbl or expressed D-Cbl in endosomes of EGF-treated COS-1
     cells is also demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. In lysates of
     adult transgenic Drosophila melanogaster, GST-DCbl binds to the
     tyrosine-phosphorylated 150-kDa torso-DER chimeric receptor. Expression of
     D-Cbl directed by the sevenless enhancer in intact Drosophila compromises
     severely the development of the R7 photoreceptor neuron. These data
     suggest that despite the lack of Grb2 binding sites, D-Cbl functions as a
     negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in the Drosophila
     eye by a mechanism that involves its association with EGF receptors or
     other tyrosine kinases.

TI  - Tpl-2 is an oncogenic kinase that is activated by carboxy-terminal
     truncation.
PG  - 688-700
AB  - Provirus insertion in the last intron of the Tpl-2 gene in
     retrovirus-induced rat T-cell lymphomas results in the enhanced expression
     of a carboxy-terminally truncated Tpl-2 kinase. Here we show that the
     truncated protein exhibits an approximately sevenfold higher catalytic
     activity and is two- to threefold more efficient in activating the MAPK
     and SAPK pathways relative to the wild-type protein. The truncated Tpl-2
     protein and a GST fusion of the Tpl-2 carboxy-terminal tail interact when
     coexpressed in Sf9 cells. Their interaction down-regulates the kinase
     activity of the truncated protein suggesting that tail-directed
     intramolecular interactions regulate the Tpl-2 kinase. Tpl-2 transgenic
     mice expressing the wild-type protein from the proximal Lck promoter fail
     to show a biological phenotype, whereas mice expressing the truncated
     protein develop large-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas of T-cell origin. These
     results show that Tpl-2 is an oncogenic kinase that is activated by
     carboxy-terminal truncation.

TI  - Conformation-dependent phosphorylation of p53.
PG  - 1686-91
AB  - Phosphorylation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is known to modulate
     its functions. Using bacterially produced glutathione S-transferase
     (GST)-p53 fusion protein and baculovirus-expressed histidine-tagged p53
     ((His)p53), we have determined human p53 phosphorylation by purified forms
     of jun-N-kinase (JNK), protein kinase A (PKA), and beta subunit of casein
     kinase II (CKIIbeta) as well as by kinases present in whole cell extracts
     (WCEs). We demonstrate that PKA is potent p53 kinase, albeit, in a
     conformation- and concentration-dependent manner, as concluded by
     comparing full-length with truncated forms of p53. We further demonstrate
     JNK interaction with GST-p53 and the ability of JNK to phosphorylate
     truncated forms of GST-p53 or full-length (His)p53. Dependence of
     phosphorylation on conformation of p53 is further supported by the finding
     that the wild-type form of p53 (p53wt) undergoes better phosphorylation by
     CKIIbeta and by WCE kinases than mutant forms of p53 at amino acid 249
     (p53(249)) or 273 (p53(273)). Moreover, shifting the kinase reaction's
     temperature from 37 degrees C to 18 degrees C reduces the phosphorylation
     of mutant p53 to a greater extent than of p53wt. Comparing truncated forms
     of p53 revealed that the ability of CKIIbeta, PKA, or WCE kinases to
     phosphorylate p53 requires amino acids 97-155 within the DNA-binding
     domain region. Among three 20-aa peptides spanning this region we have
     identified residues 97-117 that increase p53 phosphorylation by CKIIbeta
     while inhibiting p53 phosphorylation by PKA or WCE kinases. The importance
     of this region is further supported by computer modeling studies, which
     demonstrated that mutant p53(249) exhibits significant changes to the
     conformation of p53 within amino acids 97-117. In summary,
     phosphorylation-related analysis of different p53 forms in vitro indicates
     that conformation of p53 is a key determinant in its availability as a
     substrate for different kinases, as for the phosphorylation pattern
     generated by the same kinase.

TI  - Identification of the major sites of autophosphorylation of the murine
     protein-tyrosine kinase Syk.
PG  - 177-90
AB  - The protein tyrosine kinase p72syk (Syk) is expressed in a variety of
     hematopoietic cell types, including B cells, thymocytes, mast cells and
     others. Both the activity and phosphotyrosine content of this enzyme
     increase in these cells in response to engagement of the appropriate cell
     surface receptors. Herein, we describe the cloning of murine Syk and its
     expression in Sf9 cells as a catalytically active protein. Full-length Syk
     and a catalytically active 42.5 kDa carboxyl terminal fragment were also
     expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Comparative
     reverse phase HPLC and 40% alkaline gel analysis of tryptic digests of
     phosphorylated Syk demonstrated that all of the major sites of
     autophosphorylation were also present in GST-Syk and all but one were
     contained in the 42.5 kDa fragment. The sites of autophosphorylation were
     identified using a combination of Edman sequencing and mass spectrometric
     analysis. Ten sites were identified. One site is located in the amino
     terminal half of the molecule between the two tandem Src homology 2 (SH2)
     domains. Five sites are located in the hinge region located between the
     carboxyl terminal SH2 domain and the kinase domain. Two sites lie in the
     kinase domain within the catalytic loop and two near the extreme carboxyl
     terminus. Sequences of phosphorylation sites located within the hinge
     region predict that Syk serves as a docking site for other SH2
     domain-containing proteins. Consistent with this prediction,
     autophosphorylated Syk efficiently binds the carboxyl terminal SH2 domain
     of phospholipase C-gamma 1.

TI  - A domain of TEL conserved in a subset of ETS proteins defines a specific
     oligomerization interface essential to the mitogenic properties of the
     TEL-PDGFR beta oncoprotein.
PG  - 69-82
AB  - TEL is a novel member of the ETS family of transcriptional regulators
     which is frequently involved in human leukemias as the result of specific
     chromosomal translocations. We show here by co-immunoprecipitation and GST
     chromatography analyses that TEL and TEL-derived fusion proteins form
     homotypic oligomers in vitro and in vivo. Deletion mutagenesis identifies
     the TEL oligomerization domain as a 65 amino acid region which is
     conserved in a subset of the ETS proteins including ETS-1, ETS-2, FLI-1,
     ERG-2 and GABP alpha in vertebrates and PNTP2, YAN and ELG in Drosophila.
     TEL-induced oligomerization is shown to be essential for the constitutive
     activation of the protein kinase activity and mitogenic properties of
     TEL-platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR beta), a fusion
     oncoprotein characteristic of the leukemic cells of chronic myelomonocytic
     leukemia harboring a t(5;12) chromosomal translocation. Swapping
     experiments in which the TEL oligomerization domain was exchanged by the
     homologous domains of representative vertebrate ETS proteins including
     ETS-1, ERG-2 and GABP alpha show that oligomerization is a specific
     property of the TEL amino-terminal conserved domain. These results
     indicate that the amino-terminal domain conserved in a subset of the ETS
     proteins has evolved to generate a specialized protein-protein interaction
     interface which is likely to be an important determinant of their
     specificity as transcriptional regulators.

AB  - The functional ecdysteroid receptor complex consists of a nuclear receptor
     heterodimer of ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (USP). EcR and
     USP of both Chironomus tentans and Drosophila melanogaster were expressed
     in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase
     (GST). Cell lysis and protein solubilization with the anionic detergent
     sarkosyl yielded preparations of EcR and USP with properties similar to
     those of the endogenous receptors in various respects. The heterodimer of
     the expressed proteins specifically bound the labeled ecdysteroid (Ec)
     [3H]ponasterone A. Furthermore, it preferentially recognized the
     palindromic ecdysone response element (EcRE) PALI. Interestingly, binding
     to the PAL1 element was also observed for EcR homodimers. USP homodimers,
     in turn, preferentially bound to the direct repeat element DR1. When
     incubated with native polytene chromosomes of Chironomus, EcR/USP
     specifically accumulated at the early Ec-inducible puff site IV-2B.

TI  - Drosophila ribosomal protein PO contains apurinic/apyrimidinic
     endonuclease activity.
PG  - 4298-303
AB  - Drosophila ribosomal protein PO was overexpressed in Escherichia coli to
     allow for its purification, biochemical characterization and to generate
     polyclonal antibodies for Western analysis. Biochemical tests were
     originally performed to see if overexpressed PO contained DNase activity
     similar to that recently reported for the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase
     activity associated with Drosophila ribosomal protein S3. The
     overexpressed ribosomal protein was subsequently found to act on AP DNA,
     producing scissions that were in this case 5' of a baseless site instead
     of 3', as has been observed for S3. As a means of confirming that the
     source of AP endonuclease activity was in fact due to PO, glutathione
     S-transferase (GST) fusions containing a Factor Xa cleavage site between
     GST and PO were constructed, overexpressed in an E.coli strain defective
     for the major 5'-acting AP endonucleases and the fusions purified using
     glutathione-agarose affinity column chromatography. Isolated fractions
     containing purified GST-PO fusion proteins were subsequently found to have
     authentic AP endonuclease activity. Moreover, glutathione-agarose was able
     to deplete AP endonuclease activity from GST-PO fusion protein
     preparations, whereas the resin was ineffective in lowering DNA repair
     activity for PO that had been liberated from the fusion construct by
     Factor Xa cleavage. These results suggested that PO was a multifunctional
     protein with possible roles in DNA repair beyond its known participation
     in protein translation. In support of this notion, tests were performed
     that show that GST-PO, but not GST, was able to rescue an E.coli mutant
     lacking the major 5'-acting AP endonucleases from sensitivity to an
     alkylating agent. We furthermore show that GST-PO can be located in both
     the nucleus and ribosomes. Its nuclear location can be further traced to
     the nuclear matrix, thus placing PO in a subcellular location where it
     could act as a DNA repair protein. Other roles beyond DNA repair seem
     possible, however, since GST-PO also exhibited significant nuclease
     activity for both single- and double-stranded DNA.

     association: possible involvement of phosphatidylinositol turnover and
     Rho-dependent signaling pathway.
PG  - 37-51
AB  - The ERM proteins, ezrin, radixin, and moesin, are involved in the actin
     filament/plasma membrane interaction as cross-linkers. CD44 has been
     identified as one of the major membrane binding partners for ERM proteins.
     To examine the CD44/ERM protein interaction in vitro, we produced mouse
     ezrin, radixin, moesin, and the glutathione-S-transferase (GST)/CD44
     cytoplasmic domain fusion protein (GST-CD44cyt) by means of recombinant
     baculovirus infection, and constructed an in vitro assay for the binding
     between ERM proteins and the cytoplasmic domain of CD44. In this system,
     ERM proteins bound to GST-CD44cyt with high affinity (Kd of moesin was 9.3
     +/- 1.6nM) at a low ionic strength, but with low affinity at a
     physiological ionic strength. However, in the presence of
     phosphoinositides (phosphatidylinositol [PI], phosphatidylinositol
     4-monophosphate [4-PIP], and phosphatidylinositol 4.5-bisphosphate
     [4,5-PIP2]), ERM proteins bound with a relatively high affinity to
     GST-CD44cyt even at a physiological ionic strength: 4,5-PIP2 showed a
     marked effect (Kd of moesin in the presence of 4,5-PIP2 was 9.3 +/- 4.8
     nM). Next, to examine the regulation mechanism of CD44/ERM interaction in
     vivo, we reexamined the immunoprecipitated CD44/ERM complex from BHK cells
     and found that it contains Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), a
     regulator of Rho GTPase. We then evaluated the involvement of Rho in the
     regulation of the CD44/ERM complex formation. When recombinant ERM
     proteins were added and incubated with lysates of cultured BHK cells
     followed by centrifugation, a portion of the recombinant ERM proteins was
     recovered in the insoluble fraction. This binding was enhanced by GTP
     gamma S and markedly suppressed by C3 toxin, a specific inhibitor of Rho,
     indicating that the GTP form of Rho in the lysate is required for this
     binding. A mAb specific for the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 also markedly
     suppressed this binding, identifying most of the binding partners for
     exogenous ERM proteins in the insoluble fraction as CD44. Consistent with
     this binding analysis, in living BHK cells treated with C3 toxin, most
     insoluble ERM proteins moved to soluble compartments in the cytoplasm,
     leaving CD44 free from ERM. These findings indicate that Rho regulates the
     CD44/ERM complex formation in vivo and that the phosphatidylinositol
     turnover may be involved in this regulation mechanism.

PG  - 6790-5
AB  - Geminiviruses are small DNA viruses that replicate in the nuclei of
     infected plant cells. The closely related geminiviruses tomato golden
     mosaic virus and bean golden mosaic virus each encode a protein, AL1, that
     catalyzes the initiation of rolling-circle replication. Both viruses also
     specify a second replication protein, AL3, that greatly enhances the level
     of viral DNA accumulation. Using recombinant proteins produced in a
     baculovirus expression system, we showed that AL1 copurifies with a
     protein fusion of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and AL1, independent of
     the GST domain. Similarly, authentic AL3 cofractionates with a GST-AL3
     fusion protein. These results demonstrated that both AL1 and AL3 form
     oligomers. Immunoprecipitation of protein extracts from insect cells
     expressing both AL1 and AL3 showed that the two proteins also complex with
     each other. None of the protein interactions displayed virus specificity;
     the tomato and bean golden mosaic virus proteins complexed with each
     other. The addition of heterologous replication proteins had no effect on
     the efficiency of geminivirus replication in transient-replication assays,
     suggesting that heteroprotein complexes might be functional. The
     significance of these protein interactions is discussed with respect to
     geminivirus replication in plant cells.

TI  - Ligand activation of ELK receptor tyrosine kinase promotes its association
     with Grb10 and Grb2 in vascular endothelial cells.
PG  - 23588-93
AB  - ELK is a member of the Eph-related tyrosine kinase family that includes
     receptors signaling axonal guidance, neuronal bundling, and angiogenesis.
     We recently identified ELK expression in human renal microvascular
     endothelial cells and sought to identify intracellular proteins through
     which it signals responses. The cytoplasmic domain of ELK was used as
     "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify interactive proteins
     expressed from a randomly primed embryonic murine library (E9.5-10.5).
     Among interactive products of 76 cDNAs characterized, 10 nonidentical,
     overlapping clones encoded the SH2 domain of the recently reported Grb10
     adapter protein, and an additional 3 encoded Grb2. A self-phosphorylated
     recombinant, baculovirus-expressed GST-ELKcy fusion protein bound Grb10
     and Grb2 from human renal microvascular endothelial cell extracts, while
     the unphosphorylated fusion form did not. Site-directed mutation
     identified Tyr-929 as a putative phosphorylation site required for Grb10,
     but not Grb2, interaction in yeast and recombinant protein assays. The ELK
     ligand, LERK-2/Fc, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ELK, and
     recruitment of Grb10 and Grb2 to endothelial ELK receptors recovered by
     wheat germ agglutinin lectin and immunoprecipitation. These findings
     define ligand-activated interaction between ELK and the SH2 domains of
     Grb2 and the newly identified Grb10 protein that shares homology with a
     Caenorhabditis elegans gene product implicated in neural cell migration.

PG  - 47-58
AB  - All seven nonstructural (ns) proteins of the flavivirus Kunjin (KUN)
     ranging from NS1 to NS5 were expressed either alone or as fusion proteins
     with Glutathione-S-transferase (GST). High level expression of recombinant
     proteins was achieved in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using the
     baculovirus expression system in contrast to the low level of expression
     in E. coli. The order of the level of expression of the recombinant fusion
     proteins per 4 x 10(7) Sf9 cells was: GST-NS5 (yields approximately 4-5
     mg) > GST-delta NS3 (approximately 1-2 mg) > GST-4A (approximately 1 mg) >
     GST-2B (approximately 0.5-1 mg) > GST-2A (approximately 0.5 mg) > GST-4B
     (approximately 0.1-0.2 mg). NS1 protein was expressed in a native form at
     the level of approximately 2-4 mg per 4 x 10(7) Sf9 cells. All the
     GST-fusion proteins were purified by adsorption on Glutathione Sepharose
     (GS) beads from solubilized lysates of Sf9 cells infected with the
     recombinant baculoviruses, or of E. coli cultures transformed with the
     expression plasmid and induced with IPTG. Only delta NS3 protein was
     recovered intact by removing GST from the fusion protein by digestion with
     Factor Xa protease. Attempts to cleave off the GST moiety from all the
     other purified recombinant proteins resulted either in inefficient
     cleavage or in degradation of the proteins. No GST-NS5 but from 20 to 50%
     of the purified GST-NS2A, GST-NS2B, GST-delta NS3, GST-NS4A, and GST-NS4B
     was eluted off the GS beads by adding glutathione. Thus, KUN purified
     recombinant proteins, either in eluted form or while immobilized on GS
     beads, could be used to raise monospecific antibodies, to perform
     functional assays or to participate in protein-protein or RNA-protein
     binding reactions.

TI  - Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) is a binding partner for c-Src
     family protein-tyrosine kinases.
PG  - 981-8
AB  - BACKGROUND. Receptor-mediated signal transduction requires the assembly of
     multimeric complexes of signalling proteins, and a number of conserved
     protein domains, such as the SH2, SH3 and PH domains, are involved in
     mediating protein-protein interactions in such complexes. The
     identification of binding partners for these domains has added
     considerably to our understanding of signal-transduction pathways, and the
     purpose of this work was to identify SH3-binding proteins in
     haematopoietic cells. RESULTS. We performed affinity-chromatography
     experiments with a panel of GST-SH3 fusion proteins (composed of
     glutathione-S-transferase appended to various SH3 domains) to search for
     SH3-binding proteins in a human megakaryocytic cell line. Protein
     microsequencing identified one of the SH3-binding proteins as WASp, the
     protein that is defective in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) and isolated
     X-linked thrombocytopenia. WASp bound preferentially in vitro to SH3
     domains from c-Src family kinases, and analysis of proteins expressed in
     insect cells using a baculovirus vector demonstrated a specific
     interaction between WASp and the Fyn protein-tyrosine kinase. Finally, in
     vivo experiments showed that WASp and Fyn physically associate in human
     haematopoietic cells. CONCLUSIONS. Haematopoietic cells from individuals
     with WAS exhibit defects in cell morphology and signal transduction,
     including reduced proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation in response
     to stimulatory factors. Members of the c Src family of protein-tyrosine
     kinases, including Fyn, are involved in a range of signalling pathways -
     such as those regulating cytoskeletal structure - in both haematopoietic
     and non-haematopoietic cells. Our data suggest that binding of Fyn to WASp
     may be a critical event in such signalling pathways in haematopoietic
     cells.

TI  - Human homolog of Drosophila heterochromatin-associated protein 1 (HP1) is
     a DNA-binding protein which possesses a DNA-binding motif with weak
     similarity to that of human centromere protein C (CENP-C).
PG  - 153-9
AB  - Heterochromatin-associated protein 1 (HP1) is a nonhistone chromosomal
     component tightly associated with the pericentromeric heterochromatic
     region of fruit fly, mouse, and human throughout the cell cycle.
     Drosophila HP1 has been shown to be involved in position effect
     variegation and to be required for the correct chromosome segregation in
     vivo, while the biological activity of human homolog (HP1Hsa) has not yet
     been characterized. We previously reported that human CENP-B and CENP-C,
     two major centromere heterochromatin autoantigens often recognized by
     autosera in scleroderma patients, possess DNA-binding activity in vitro.
     Here, we show that human HP1, which is also an autoantigen targeted by
     some types of anticentromere autosera, is a DNA-binding protein. Human HP1
     was expressed as a GST-fusion in Escherichia coli and purified with
     glutathione-Sepharose. The DNA-binding activity of the recombinant HP1 was
     demonstrated by gel mobility shift assay and South-Western-type blotting.
     The minimum DNA-binding region was further limited to the internal
     64-amino acid stretch that is less-conserved between human and fruit fly
     but retains a helix-enriched motif with weak similarity to CENP-C. This
     suggests that HP1 is involved in the pericentromeric heterochromatin
     formation by directly associating with genomic DNA.

     as fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase elicit neutralizing
     antibody in mice.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - We have recently shown that neutralizing epitope(s) exist near the
     C-terminal of JE virus E-protein by expressing the coding gene cDNA
     fragments as fusion proteins with protein A. Among four cDNA fragments,
     the fragment (B3) carrying the coding sequence of amino acid number
     373-399 of E protein elicited the highest neutralizing (N) antibody titer
     (1:75). To exclude the possible influence of protein A contained in the
     expressed gene products on the mouse immune response, we expressed (B3)
     using pGEX-3X expression vector as fusion with glutathione-S transferase
     (GST). The mice immunized with recombinant GST-B3 fusion protein induced
     an immune response (mean average ELISA: 3364; N: 1:75) almost similar to
     that by recombinant protein A-B3 fusion protein (mean average ELISA: 3476;
     N: 1:75). While hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies were not
     induced by this fusion protein. These results indicate that 27 amino acid
     sequence on the E protein (373-399) was sufficient to induce neutralizing
     antibodies without association with protein A moiety.

TI  - A point mutation in the microtubule binding region of the Ncd motor
     protein reduces motor velocity.
PG  - 3306-14
AB  - Non-claret disjunctional (Ncd) is a kinesin-related microtubule motor
     protein in Drosophila that functions in meiotic spindle assembly in
     oocytes and spindle pole maintenance in early embryos. The partial
     loss-of-function mutant ncdD retains mitotic, but not meiotic, function.
     The predicted NcdD mutant protein contains a V556-->F mutation in the
     putative microtubule binding region of the Ncd motor domain. Here we
     report an analysis of the properties of recombinant Ncd and NcdD proteins.
     A GST-NcdD fusion protein translocated microtubules approximately 10-fold
     more slowly than the corresponding wild-type protein in gliding assays.
     The maximum microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity of an NcdD motor domain
     protein was reduced approximately 3-fold and an approximately 3-fold
     greater concentration of microtubules was required for half-maximal
     stimulation of ATPase activity, compared with the corresponding wild-type
     protein. The Km for ATP and basal rate of ATP turnover were, in contrast,
     similar for the NcdD mutant and wild-type Ncd motor domain proteins.
     Pelleting assays demonstrated that the binding of the mutant NcdD motor
     protein to microtubules was reduced in the absence of nucleotide, relative
     to wild-type. The reduced velocity of NcdD translocation on microtubules
     is therefore correlated with reductions in microtubule-stimulated ATPase
     activity and affinity of the mutant motor for microtubules. The
     characteristics of the NcdD motor explain its meiotic loss of function,
     and are consistent with partial motor activity of Ncd being sufficient for
     its mitotic, but not its meiotic, role.

TI  - Reconstitution of a pentameric complex of dimeric transforming growth
     factor beta ligand and a type I, II, III receptor in baculoviral-infected
     insect cells.
PG  - 345-60
AB  - Two transmembrane serine-threonine kinases (type I and II receptors), a
     membrane-anchored proteoglycan (type III), and a homodimeric ligand
     participate in the transforming growth factor beta type one (TGF beta 1)
     signal transduction complex. The expression of recombinant receptors in
     insect cells co-infected with up to three recombinant baculoviruses was
     employed to study interactions among the ectodomains of the three types of
     receptors and the TGF beta 1 ligand in absence of uncontrollable extrinsic
     factors in mammalian cells. Multi-subunit complexes were assembled in
     intact cells and purified on glutathione-conjugated beads for analysis by
     tagging one of the subunits with glutathione S-transferase (GST).
     Intrinsic ligand-independent interactions were observed among receptor
     subunits as follows: type III-III, type I-I, type III-I, and type II-I.
     The homeotypic complex of type II-II receptors and the heterotypic type
     III-II interaction was ligand dependent. The type I, but not the type III,
     subunit displaced about 50% of the type II component in either
     ligand-dependent homomeric type II-type II complexes or heteromeric type
     III-type II complexes to form type II-I or type III-II-I oligomers,
     respectively. The type II subunit displaced type I subunits in oligomers
     of the type I subunit. Specificity of type I receptors may result from
     differential affinity for the type II receptor rather than specificity for
     ligand. A monomeric subunit of the TGF beta 1 ligand bound concurrently to
     type III and type II or type III and type I receptors, but failed to
     concurrently bind to the type II and type I subunits. The binding of TGF
     beta 1 to the type I kinase subunit appears to require an intact
     disulfide-linked ligand dimer in the absence of a type III subunit. The
     combined results suggest a pentameric TGF beta signal transduction complex
     in which one unit each of the type III, type II, and type I components is
     assembled around the two subunits of the dimeric TGF beta ligand. An
     immobilized GST-tagged subunit of the receptor complex was utilized to
     assemble multi-subunit complexes in vitro and to study the phosphorylation
     events among subunits in the absence of extrinsic cell-derived kinases.
     The results revealed that (a) a low level of ligand-independent
     autophosphorylation occurs in the type I kinase; (b) a high level of
     autophosphorylation occurs in the type II kinase; (c) both the type III
     and type I subunits are trans-phosphorylated by the type II subunit; and
     (d) the presence of both type I and II kinases complexed with the type III
     subunit and dimeric TGF beta 1 ligand in a pentameric complex causes
     maximum phosphorylation of all three receptor subunits.

PG  - 275-9
AB  - A non-myristylated form (LCK M) of the human T-lymphocyte-specific protein
     tyrosine kinase (LCK) was produced at high levels in a baculovirus
     expression system (BVES) using two strategies. First, LCK M was produced
     by direct expression of a Gly2 --> Ala mutant of LCK. Second, LCK was
     produced as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion, and LCK M was
     derived from the fusion protein by cleavage with thrombin. Both
     recombinant proteins (re-proteins) were produced at 5% of the total
     protein of infected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells and were purified to
     >95% homogeneity. The enzymatic properties of the re-proteins and their
     inhibition by protein kinase inhibitors were comparable to the native
     enzyme (LCK N) derived from Jurkat cells and wild-type LCK derived from
     the BVES. The high production levels will facilitate the recovery of large
     quantities of re-protein for use in biochemical and biophysical studies.

TI  - Characterization of novel vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
     receptors on tumor cells that bind VEGF165 via its exon 7-encoded domain.
PG  - 5761-7
AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor,
     uses two receptor tyrosine kinases, FLK/KDR and FLT, to mediate its
     activities. We have cross-linked 125I-VEGF165 to the cell surface of
     various tumor cell lines and of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
     High molecular mass (220 and 240 kDa) and/or lower molecular mass (165 and
     175 kDa) labeled complexes were detected depending on the cell type. The
     220- and 240-kDa labeled complexes were shown to contain FLT and FLK/KDR
     receptors, respectively. On the other hand, the 165- and 175-kDa complexes
     did not seem to contain FLK/KDR or FLT but instead appeared to contain
     novel VEGF receptors with relatively low molecular masses of approximately
     120 and 130 kDa. These receptors were further characterized in breast
     cancer MDA MB 231 cells (231), which did not form the high molecular mass
     complexes and which did not express detectable amounts of flk/kdr or flt
     mRNA. The 231 cells displayed one VEGF165 binding site, with a Kd of 2.8 x
     10(-10) M and 0.95 1.1 x 10(5) binding sites per cell. By comparison,
     human umbilical vein endothelial cells had two binding sites, one with a
     Kd of 7.5 x 10(-12) M, presumably FLK/KDR, and the other with a Kd of 2 x
     10(-10) M, a value similar to the VEGF binding sites on 231 cells. These
     lower affinity/molecular mass receptors on 231 cells cross-linked
     125I-VEGF165 but not 125I-VEGF121. Accordingly, exon 7 of VEGF, which
     encodes the 44 amino acids present in VEGF165 that are absent in VEGF121,
     was fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). The GST-VEGF-exon 7 fusion
     protein bound to heparin-Sepharose with a similar affinity as VEGF165 and
     inhibited the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to 231 cells. Cross-linking of
     125I-GST-VEGF-exon 7 to 231 cells resulted in the formation of 150- and
     160-kDa labeled complexes that presumably contained the 120- and 130-kDa
     lower affinity/molecular mass VEGF165 receptors. It was concluded that
     certain tumor-derived cell lines express novel surface-associated
     receptors that selectively bind VEGF165 via the exon 7-encoded domain,
     which is absent in VEGF121.

TI  - The hepatitis delta virus large antigen is farnesylated both in vitro and
     in animal cells.
PG  - 4569-72
AB  - The hepatitis delta virus large antigen (lHDAg) is a virally encoded
     protein that contains a prenylation signal sequence at its carboxyl
     terminus consisting of the tetrapeptide Cys-Arg-Pro-Gln. Although the
     presence of the Gln as the COOH-terminal residue generally specifies
     addition of the 15-carbon farnesyl isoprenoid, earlier reports had
     suggested that the protein is modified by the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl.
     The prenylation of lHDAg was examined in vitro using a fusion protein
     between glutathione S-transferase and the COOH-terminal 117 amino acids of
     lHDAg (GST-lHDAg). When recombinant GST-lHDAg was incubated with bovine
     brain cytosol in the presence of either farnesyl diphosphate or
     geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GST-lHDAg was preferentially farnesylated.
     Geranylgeranylation of the fusion protein was also observed, although at a
     rate considerably less than that of farnesylation. Using purified
     recombinant protein prenyltransferases, GST-lHDAg was found to be an
     excellent substrate (apparent Km = 0.8 microM) for protein
     farnesyltransferase (FTase), while modification by protein
     geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) was not detected. FTase was also
     able to catalyze geranylgeranylation of GST-lHDAg at a very low rate,
     suggesting that the low level of geranylgeranylation of GST-lHDAg observed
     in cytosolic preparations was mediated by FTase. Consistent with our
     observations on the in vitro prenylation of the GST-lHDAg fusion protein,
     isoprenoid analysis of authentic lHDAg expressed in COS cells demonstrated
     that the protein was farnesylated. Geranylgeranylation of lHDAg expressed
     in COS cells was not observed. As prenylation of lHDAg is required for the
     assembly of the hepatitis delta viral particle, these results suggest that
     inhibitors of FTase may be useful therapeutic agents for treatment of
     delta virus infection.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of cDNA for DREF, a promoter-activating
     factor for Drosophila DNA replication-related genes.
PG  - 3930-7
AB  - DREF, a transcription regulatory factor which specifically binds to the
     promoter-activating element DRE (DNA replication-related element) of DNA
     replication-related genes, was purified to homogeneity from nuclear
     extracts of Drosophila Kc cells. cDNA for DREF was isolated with the
     reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method using primers
     synthesized on the basis of partial amino acid sequences and following
     screening of cDNA libraries. Deduced from the nucleotide sequences of
     cDNA, DREF is a polypeptide of 701 amino acid residues with a molecular
     weight of 80,096, which contains three characteristic regions, rich in
     basic amino acids, proline, and acidic amino acids, respectively. Deletion
     analysis of bacterially expressed DREF fused with glutathione
     S-transferase (GST-DREF) indicated that a part of the N-terminal basic
     amino acid region (16-115 amino acids) is responsible for the specific
     binding to DRE. A polyclonal and four monoclonal antibodies were raised
     against the GST-DREF fusion protein. The antibodies inhibited specifically
     the transcription of DNA polymerase alpha promoter in vitro.
     Cotransfection experiments using Kc cells demonstrated that overproduction
     of DREF protein overcomes the repression of the proliferating cell nuclear
     antigen gene promoter by the zerknullt gene product. These results
     confirmed that DREF is a trans-activating factor for DNA
     replication-related genes. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated the
     presence of DREF polypeptide in nuclei after the eighth nuclear division
     cycle, suggesting that nuclear accumulation of DREF is important for the
     coordinate zygotic expression of DNA replication-related genes carrying
     DRE sequences.

AB  - PrP27-30 represents the protease-resistant core of the prion protein and
     was found to be the main component in Scrapie prion preparations.
     Recombinant (r) PrP27-30 corresponding to aa 90-231 from the Syrian golden
     hamster prion protein was expressed as a fusion with GST in E. coli and
     secreted from insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses,
     GST::rPrP27-30 isolated from either system was purified to homogenity by
     glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. rPrP27-30 from both systems was
     generated by direct cleavage of GST::rPrP27-30 in the presence of thrombin
     revealing a molecular weight of 17 kDa. GST::rPrP27-30 as well as the
     authentic protein rPrP27-30 were identified by immunoblotting employing a
     polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to aa 95-110
     of the Syrian golden hamster prion protein. In contrast to scrapie prior
     PrP27-30, the recombinant proteins GST::rPrP27-30 and rPrP27-30 were both
     sensitive towards proteinase K, suggesting that the molecules lack
     infectivity.

TI  - cDNA cloning of a murine homologue of Drosophila single-minded, its mRNA
     expression in mouse development, and chromosome localization.
PG  - 588-94
AB  - A combination of the RT-PCR method and subsequent screening of the cDNA
     library of mouse skeletal muscle with the cDNA isolated by RT-PCR used as
     a probe led to isolation of cDNAs encoding a polypeptide (mSim) with bHLH
     and PAS domains which show high similarity to the corresponding regions of
     Drosophila Sim, a master regulator in neurogenesis. Experiments using a
     GST-fusion protein demonstrated that mSim heterodimerizes with Arnt (Ah
     receptor nuclear translocator), even more efficiently than AhR (Ah
     receptor) does with Arnt. RNA blot analysis using RNAs from various
     tissues of mice indicated that mSim transcript is expressed in several
     limited tissues such as muscle, kidney and lung of adult animals.
     Distribution of mSim mRNA was always accompanied with that of Arnt. All
     the results suggest a regulatory role of mSim in partnership with Arnt.
     Chromosomal location of the mSim gene was determined by fluorescent in
     situ hybridization to be localized on the C3.3-C4 band of mouse chromosome
     16 which is syntenic with the human chromosome 21q22 carrying the Down
     syndrome critical region, where a gene highly homologous to the Drosophila
     sim was localized. Whole mount in situ hybridization using a unique part
     of mSim cDNA sequence showed that mSim mRNA was expressed in the ventral
     diencephalon, branchial arches and limbs. These findings will provide an
     approach to the cause of the Down syndrome as well as the elucidation of
     the functional roles of mSim in animal development.

PG  - 25159-65
AB  - We have found sequences similar to the transcription factor E2F
     recognition site within the Drosophila proliferating cell nuclear antigen
     (PCNA) gene promoter. These sequences are located at positions -43 to -36
     (site I). and -56 to -49 (site II) with respect to the cap site
     Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-E2F and GST-DP fusion proteins cooperate
     and bind to the potential E2F sites in the PCNA promoter in vitro. A
     binding factor(s) to these sequences that has similar binding specificity
     to that of E2F was detected in nuclear extracts of Drosophila Kc cells.
     Furthermore, transient expression of target site for the activation
     coincided with the E2F sites. These results indicate that the PCNA gene is
     a likely target gene of E2F. Examination of lacZ expression from PCNA-lacZ
     fusion genes carrying mutations in either or both of two E2F sites
     introduced into flies by germ line transformation revealed that site II
     plays a major role in the PCNA promoter activity during embryogenesis and
     larval development, although both sites are required for optimal promoter
     activity. However, for maternal expression in ovaries, either one of the
     two sites is essentially sufficient to direct optimal promoter activity.
     These results demonstrate, for the first time, an essential role for E2F
     sites in regulation of PCNA promoter activity during development of a
     multicellular organism.

AB  - The biochemical interactions between digestive proteinases of the
     Coleoptera pest black vine weevil (Otiorynchus sulcatus) and two plant
     cysteine proteinase inhibitors, oryzacystatin I (OCI) and oryzacystatin II
     (OCII), were assessed using gelatin-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
     OCI-affinity chromatography, and recombinant forms of the two plant
     inhibitors. The insect proteinases were resolved in gelatin-containing
     polyacrylamide gels as five major bands, only three of them being totally
     or partially inactivated by OCI and OCII. The maximal inhibitory effect of
     both OCs at pH 5.0 was estimated at 40% and the inhibition was stable with
     time despite the presence of OC-insensitive proteases, indicating the
     stability of the OCI and OCII effects. After removing OC-sensitive
     proteinases from the insect crude extract by OCI-affinity chromatography,
     the effects of the insect cystatin-insensitive proteases on the structural
     integrity of the free OCs were analyzed. While OCI remained stable, OCII
     was subjected to limited proteolysis leading to its gradual transformation
     into a approximately 10.5-kDa unstable intermediate, OCIIi. As shown by
     the degradation pattern of a glutathione S-transferase (GST)/OCII fusion
     protein, the appearance of OCIIi resulted from the C-terminal truncation
     of OCII. Either free or linked to GST, OCIIi was as active against papain
     and human cathepsin H as OCII, and the initial specificities of the
     inhibitor for these two cysteine proteinases were conserved after
     cleavage. Although these observations indicate the high conformational
     stability of OCII near its active (inhibitory) site, they also suggest a
     general conformational destabilization of this inhibitor following its
     initial cleavage, subsequently leading to its complete hydrolysis. This
     apparent susceptibility of OCII to proteolytic cleavage by the insect
     proteinases could have major implications when planning the use of this
     plant cystatin for insect pest control.

PG  - 20660-7
AB  - A protein called Tip (tyrosine kinase interacting protein) of herpesvirus
     saimiri associates with Lck in virus-transformed human T cells and is an
     in vitro substrate for Lck kinase. Mutational analyses of a GST-Tip fusion
     protein revealed that binding to Lck requires putative SH3 binding
     sequences and a sequence homologous to the carboxyl terminus of
     Src-related kinases. These sequences are referred to as SH3-Binding (SH3B)
     and C-terminal Src-related Kinase Homology (CSKH) elements. Peptide
     fragments as short as 37 amino acids containing both SH3B and CSKH
     elements were sufficient to form a stable complex with Lck in vitro.
     Furthermore, these same sequences of Tip were necessary for in vivo
     association with Lck when Tip and Lck were expressed transiently in COS-1
     cells or stably in Rat-1 cell lines. These results demonstrate that the
     CSKH element of Tip participates in the binding of sequences within Lck.
     Tip of herpesvirus saimiri has apparently acquired such CSKH and SH3B
     elements for the purpose of targeting cellular protein kinases. The
     interaction of Tip with Lck may influence Lck kinase activity or its
     binding to other cellular proteins and thereby alter Lck function in T
     cells infected by h. saimiri.

AB  - This article describes a procedure which permits for the first time the
     isolation of the prion protein PrPc from the Syrian golden hamster in
     heterologous systems. Using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion
     approach, milligram amounts of stable, soluble, and homogeneous GST::PrPc
     protein were obtained in Escherichia coli and with baculovirus-infected
     insect cells. Authentic PrPc was released from the immobilized fusion
     protein by direct cleavage with thrombin. GST::PrPc expressed in these two
     expression systems and also authentic PrPc released by thrombin cleavage
     were recognized by a polyclonal antibody directed against amino acid 95 to
     110 of the golden hamster PrPc protein. GST::PrPc was not detected by a
     monoclonal antibody recognizing the region encompassing amino acids 138 to
     152 of the human prion protein. The fusion protein was sensitive to
     proteinase K digestion, demonstrating that the cellular rather than the
     proteinase K-resistant scrapie isoform was produced.

TI  - The Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) is an SH3 domain-binding protein
     and substrate for the Src-related tyrosine kinase, Hck.
PG  - 14718-24
AB  - The Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) is a target for protein tyrosine
     kinases of both the receptor and cytoplasmic classes and may serve to
     integrate tyrosine kinase and Ras signaling pathways. In this report, we
     provide evidence that GAP is an SH3 domain-binding protein and substrate
     for the Src-related tyrosine kinase Hck, which has been implicated in the
     regulation of myeloid cell growth, differentiation, and function.
     Wild-type (WT) or kinase-inactive (K269E) mutant Hck proteins were
     co-expressed with bovine GAP using the baculovirus/Sf-9 cell system. GAP
     was readily phosphorylated on tyrosine by WT but not K269E Hck. GAP was
     present in WT Hck immunoprecipitates from the co-infected cells,
     indicative of Hck.GAP complex formation. Unexpectedly, GAP also associated
     with the kinase-inactive mutant of Hck, suggesting that tyrosine
     autophosphorylation of Hck is not required for complex formation. The WT
     and K269E forms of Hck also associated with GAP mutants lacking either the
     C-terminal catalytic domain (delta CAT) or the Src homology region (delta
     SH), indicating that these GAP domains are dispensable for complex
     formation. Recombinant GST fusion proteins containing the Hck, Src, Fyn,
     or Lck SH3 domains associated with full-length GAP, delta CAT, and delta
     SH, all of which share an N-terminal proline-rich region resembling an
     SH3-binding motif (PPLPPPPPQLP). Deletion of the highly conserved YXY
     sequence from the Hck SH3 domain abolished binding. GAP-SH3 interaction
     was also inhibited by the proline-rich peptide GFPPLPPPPPQLPTLG, which
     corresponds to N-terminal amino acids 129-144 of bovine GAP. An N-terminal
     deletion mutant of GAP lacking this proline-rich region did not bind to
     the Hck SH3 domain. These data implicate the Hck SH3 domain in GAP
     interaction, and suggest a general function for the SH3 domains of Src
     family kinases in recognition of GAP via its proline-rich N-terminal
     domain.

     glycoprotein.
PG  - 1381-92
AB  - The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) open reading frame BDLF3 is predicted to code
     for a glycoprotein on the basis that it contains sequences with signal
     peptide and transdomain characteristics and nine potential N-linked
     glycosylation sites. No sequential or positional homologues of BDLF3 have
     been located in other herpesviruses. A bacterial glutathione S-transferase
     (GST)-BDLF3 fusion protein was used to demonstrate that over one-third of
     EBV-immune human sera tested recognized the fusion protein but not GST
     alone on Western blots. The fusion protein was used to raise polyclonal
     sera in rabbits. A BDLF3 recombinant baculovirus was constructed using the
     full-length BDLF3 sequence (AcBDLF3). Rabbit anti-fusion protein sera and
     some human EBV-immune sera recognized products of approximately 30 and 55
     kDa from AcBDLF3-infected insect cells by Western blotting. A peptide
     representing the carboxy-terminal amino acids 215-234 of the BDLF3
     sequence was used to raise anti-peptide sera in rabbits. Anti-peptide
     serum detected a product by indirect immunofluorescence in acetone-fixed
     EBV-infected B cells from all cell lines tested. A diffuse band with a
     molecular mass of 100-150 kDa was detected by Western blot in B95-8 cell
     lysates, partially purified B95-8 virus and B95-8-infected cell membranes
     after probing with anti-BDLF3 peptide serum. This product was shown to be
     glycosylated after enzymatic deglycosylation of a B95-8 virus preparation
     using neuraminidase, O-glycosidase or N-glycosidase F. The BDLF3 protein
     products have no known function.

TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a conserved nuclear
     serine(threonine) protein kinase.
PG  - 5022-6
AB  - Human, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans cDNA clones
     encoding homologues of a serine(threonine) protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37)
     (designated Ndr protein kinase) have been isolated and sequenced. The
     human and Drosophila cDNAs predict polypeptides of 54 kDa and 52 kDa,
     respectively, which share approximately 80% amino acid similarity.
     Northern analysis of human tissues revealed a ubiquitously expressed
     3.9-kb transcript. Recombinant GST-Ndr underwent intramolecular
     autophosphorylation on serine and threonine residues in vitro but failed
     to transphosphorylate several standard protein kinase substrates.
     Transfection of the human cDNA into COS-1 cells resulted in the appearance
     of an intense nuclear staining in cells analyzed by indirect
     immunofluorescence; deletion mutagenesis identified a short basic peptide,
     KRKAETWKRNRR, responsible for the nuclear accumulation of Ndr. Thus, Ndr
     is a conserved and widely expressed nuclear protein kinase. The closest

     kinase C substrate in vitro.
PG  - 837-44
AB  - The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef protein was expressed in
     Escherichia coli as a C-terminal fusion with glutathione S-transferase
     (GST). The ability of GST-Nef to act as a substrate for cellular kinases
     in vitro was examined by incubation of purified GST-Nef fusion proteins,
     immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, with cytoplasmic extracts from a
     number of human cell lines. In the presence of [gamma32P]ATP,
     phosphorylation of Nef occurred predominantly on serine residues. Studies
     with protein kinase inhibitors suggested that protein kinase C (PKC) was
     involved in Nef phosphorylation. This was supported further by the
     demonstration that purified PKC was also able to phosphorylate Nef in the
     absence of cell extract. Serine/threonine phosphorylation of Nef was also
     observed in vivo when Nef was expressed with a C-terminal GST or
     6-histidine tag in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells by recombinant
     baculoviruses. In extracts from Jurkat T cells and U937
     monocyte/macrophages Nef also associated with a 57 kDa cellular protein
     that was itself phosphorylated in vitro. Phosphorylation of this
     Nef-associated protein was inhibited by heparin and is thus likely to be
     mediated by casein kinase II. The observation that PKC can phosphorylate
     Nef in vitro raises the possibility that PKC might play a role in
     regulating both Nef function and the physical interactions between Nef and
     cellular components.

PG  - 5742-7
AB  - G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signaling is attenuated by a process
     referred to as desensitization, wherein agonist-dependent phosphorylation
     of receptors by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) is proposed to
     be a key initial event. However, mechanisms that activate GRKs are not
     fully understood. In one scenario, beta gamma-subunits of G proteins (G
     beta gamma) activate certain GRKs (beta-adrenergic receptor kinases 1 and
     2, or GRK2 and GRK3), via a pleckstrin homology domain in the COOH
     terminus. This interaction has been proposed to translocate cytosolic
     beta-adrenergic receptor kinases (beta ARKs) to the plasma membrane and
     facilitate interaction with receptor substrates. Here, we report a novel
     finding that membrane lipids modulate beta ARK activity in vitro in a
     manner that is analogous and competitive with G beta gamma. Several
     lipids, including phosphatidylserine (PS), stimulated, whereas
     phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate inhibited, the ability of these GRKs
     to phosphorylate agonist-occupied m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
     Furthermore, both PS and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
     specifically bound to beta ARK1, whereas phosphatidylcholine, a lipid that
     did not modulate beta ARK activity, did not bind to beta ARK1. The lipid
     regulation of beta ARKs did not occur via a modulation of its
     autophosphorylation state. PS- and G beta gamma-mediated stimulation of
     beta ARK1 was compared and found strikingly similar; moreover, their
     effects together were not additive (except at initial stages of reaction),
     which suggests that PS and G beta gamma employed a common interaction and
     activation mechanism with the kinase. The effects of these lipids were
     prevented by two well known G beta gamma-binding proteins, phosducin and
     GST-beta ARK-(466-689) fusion protein, suggesting that the G beta
     gamma-binding domain (possibly the pleckstrin homology domain) of the GRKs
     is also a site for lipid:protein interaction. We submit the intriguing
     possibility that both lipids and G proteins co-regulate the function of
     GRKs.

TI  - Tyrosine phosphorylation of p95Vav in myeloid cells is regulated by
     GM-CSF, IL-3 and steel factor and is constitutively increased by
     p210BCR/ABL.
PG  - 257-65
AB  - Vav is a recently described proto-oncogene expressed only in hematopoietic
     cells which contains an SH2 and two SH3 domains and shares homology with
     the Dbl GDP-GTP exchange factor and BCR. p95Vav is phosphorylated on
     tyrosine residues in response to stimulation of the T cell antigen
     receptor, cross-linking of IgE or IgM receptors and stimulation of
     immature hematopoietic cells by Steel factor. Monoclonal antibodies to
     human Vav were generated and used to examine the events which regulate
     tyrosine phosphorylation of p95Vav in myeloid cells. In the
     factor-dependent MO7e cell line, p95Vav was rapidly phosphorylated on
     tyrosine residues in a dose- and time-dependent manner by GM-CSF, IL-3 and
     Steel factor. Introduction of the BCR/ABL oncogene into this cell line
     resulted in factor-independent proliferation and constitutive
     phosphorylation of p95Vav. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p95Vav was also
     substantially increased by treatment of cytokine-deprived cells with the
     tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate. Since many of the
     cytokines known to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p95Vav are also
     known to activate JAK family tyrosine kinases, we looked for an
     interaction of p95Vav with JAK kinases. p95Vav co-precipitated with JAK2
     in MO7e cells stimulated with GM-CSF, but not in unstimulated cells. Also,
     JAK2 was found to be constitutively associated with p95Vav in vivo when
     expressed at high levels in insect cells using baculovirus vectors. A
     fusion protein consisting of glutathione-S-transferase and the SH2 domain
     of p95Vav (GST-Vav-SH2) precipitated JAK2, suggesting that this
     interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of p95Vav.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

AB  - We have generated a series of fusion proteins carrying portions of subunit
     IIc, the second largest subunit of Drosophila RNA polymerase I, and have
     used them in a domain interference assay to identify a fragment of the IIc
     subunit that carries the binding site for a basal transcription factor.
     Fusion proteins carrying a subunit IIc fragment spanning residues
     Ala519-Gly992 strongly inhibit promoter-driven transcription in both
     unfractionated nuclear extracts and in reconstituted systems. The same
     fusion proteins similarly inhibit dTFIIF stimulation of Pol II elongation
     on dC-tailed templates, suggesting that the IIc(A519-G992) fragment, which
     carries conserved regions D-H, interferes with transcription by binding to
     dTFIIF. Finally, dTFIIF can be specifically cross-linked to a
     GST-IIc(A519-G992) fusion protein or to subunit IIc in intact Pol II.

TI  - Direct binding to and tyrosine phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the
     type I interferon receptor by p135tyk2 tyrosine kinase.
PG  - 8133-42
AB  - Binding of type I interferons (IFNs) to their receptors induces rapid
     tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins, including the alpha and
     beta subunits of the receptor, the polypeptides that form the
     transcriptional activator ISGF3 alpha (Stat113, Stat84, and Stat91), and
     the p135tyk2 and Jak-1 tyrosine kinases. In this report, we demonstrate
     that the alpha subunit of the type I IFN receptor (IFN-R) corresponds to
     the product of a previously cloned receptor subunit cDNA and, further,
     that the p135tyk2 tyrosine kinase directly binds and tyrosine
     phosphorylates this receptor subunit. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)
     fusion proteins encoding the different regions of the cytoplasmic domain
     of the alpha subunit can bind the p135tyk2 contained in human cell
     lysates. The association between the alpha subunit and Tyk2 was
     demonstrated by immunoblotting with anti-Tyk2 and antiphosphotyrosine
     antibodies and by using an in vitro kinase assay. Analogous experiments
     were then performed with recombinant baculoviruses encoding constitutively
     active Jak family tyrosine kinases. In this case, p135tyk2, but not Jak-1
     or Jak-2 protein, binds to the GST-IFN-R proteins, suggesting that the
     interaction between these two proteins is both direct and specific. We
     also demonstrate that Tyk2, from extracts of either IFN alpha-treated
     human cells or insect cells infected with the recombinant baculoviruses,
     can catalyze in vitro phosphorylation of GST-IFN-R protein in a specific
     manner. Deletion mutants of the GST-IFN-R protein were used to localize
     both the binding and tyrosine phosphorylation site(s) to a 46-amino-acid
     juxtamembrane region of the alpha subunit, which shows sequence homology
     to functionally similar regions of other cytokine receptor proteins. These
     data support the hypothesis that the Tyk2 protein functions as part of a
     receptor complex to initiate intracellular signaling in response to type I
     IFNs.

     Furthermore, we used the purified hER to analyze the complex estrogen
     response element (ERE) in the promoter of the oxytocin-encoding gene.

TI  - Insect cell-expressed p180erbB3 possesses an impaired tyrosine kinase
     activity.
PG  - 8132-6
AB  - Protein kinases share a number of highly conserved or invariant amino acid
     residues in their catalytic domains, suggesting that these residues are
     necessary for kinase activity. In p180erbB3, a receptor tyrosine kinase
     belonging to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor subfamily, three
     of these residues are altered, suggesting that this protein might have an
     impaired protein tyrosine kinase activity. To test this hypothesis, we
     have expressed human EGF receptor and bovine p180erbB3 in insect cells via
     baculovirus infection and have compared their autophosphorylation and
     substrate phosphorylation activities. We have found that, while the EGF
     receptor readily undergoes EGF-stimulated autophosphorylation and
     catalyzes the incorporation of phosphate into the model substrates (E4Y1)n
     (random 4:1 copolymer of glutamic acid and tyrosine) and GST-p85
     (glutathione S-transferase fusion protein with the 85-kDa subunit of
     phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), p180erbB3 autophosphorylation and
     substrate phosphorylation are at least 2 orders of magnitude less
     efficient. However, p180erbB3 is capable of binding the ATP analog
     5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, indicating that the lack of observed
     kinase activity is probably not due to nonfunctional or denatured
     receptors expressed by the insect cells. On the basis of these results, we
     propose that p180erbB3 possesses an impaired intrinsic tyrosine kinase
     activity.

TI  - Myristoylation-dependent binding of HIV-1 Nef to CD4.
PG  - 136-42
AB  - The nef gene is conserved throughout the primate lentivirus family.
     Although dispensable in vitro, an important role for nef in vivo is
     suggested by the failure of SIV nef mutants to establish persistent
     viraemia. Although the biochemical function of the Nef protein remains
     equivocal, a consistent theme has emerged with the reproducible
     observation that Nef expression results in the down-modulation of the cell
     surface marker CD4. Down-modulation requires amino acid sequences within
     the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 but occurs by a mechanism distinct from the
     normal serine phosphorylation-dependent pathway. As CD4 is a transmembrane
     glycoprotein and Nef a myristoylated protein targeted to the cytoplasmic
     face of the plasma membrane we considered that a direct interaction
     between Nef and CD4 might play a role in down-modulation. Here we
     demonstrate that a baculovirus-expressed Nef-GST fusion protein interacts
     specifically with CD4. This interaction requires co-expression in the same
     cell and is dependent on Nef myristoylation. The site of Nef interaction
     maps to the cytoplasmic domain of CD4, as a deletion mutant lacking this
     domain fails to interact with Nef. This observation sheds new light on the
     biochemical function of Nef and offers new opportunities for the future
     development of HIV chemotherapy.

TI  - The regulatory region of protein kinase C gamma. Studies of phorbol ester
     binding to individual and combined functional segments expressed as
     glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins indicate a complex mechanism of
     regulation by phospholipids, phorbol esters, and divalent cations.
PG  - 20000-12
AB  - The regulatory domain of protein kinase C gamma (PKC gamma) contains the
     following functional elements which can interact with lipids: the
     pseudosubstrate motif within the first variable region (V1), cysteine-rich
     domains, Cys1 and Cys2 which contain zinc and bind phorbol dibutyrate
     (PDBu)/diacylglycerol, and the calcium-dependent lipid binding domain
     (CaLB). The function of individual or combined segments of the regulatory
     domain was investigated, using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion
     proteins and mixed micellar or liposomal assays. GST-Cys1 and GST-Cys2
     bound PDBu with comparable affinity (Kd = 14-17 nM). GST-Cys1Cys2 yielded
     a protein with a PDBu binding affinity of 3.4 nM, in the presence of
     calcium, similar to that of intact PKC gamma (Kd = 2.6 nM). The
     phosphatidylserine (PS) dependence of PDBu binding was highly cooperative
     for all fusion proteins tested with Hill numbers (n) lying in the range of
     3.5-4.8, similar to values obtained for intact PKC gamma. While Hill
     numbers were similar under all conditions, the PS concentration necessary
     for half-maximal PDBu binding was dependent upon the nature and presence
     of divalent cations. The PS requirement was lowest in the presence of
     calcium for GST-Cys1, GST-Cys2, and GST-Cys1Cys2 (Km for PS = 11, 14, and
     12 mol %, respectively) but still significantly above the value for intact
     PKC gamma (5.4 mol %). The data establish Cys1 and Cys2 as independent
     PDBu binding domains that are modulated by divalent cations. While PDBu
     binding affinity to a GST-V1Cys1 fusion protein (Kd = 36 nM) was
     comparable to that of GST-Cys1, the CaLB domain dramatically reduced PDBu
     binding affinity of GST-Cys2CaLB (Kd = 912 nM). This effect of the CaLB
     domain on PDBu binding to Cys2 suggests that PDBu/diacylglycerol binding
     to native PKC gamma may occur at Cys1 and that the Cys2 domain may serve
     another regulatory function.

TI  - Inhibition of p53 DNA binding by human papillomavirus E6 proteins.
PG  - 4262-73
AB  - Transformation by the human papillomavirus (HPV) early gene products, E6
     and E7, involves their interaction with cellular proteins p53 and Rb.
     Using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, we found that HPV
     E6 bound human p53 and that the relative efficiency of binding varied such
     that the GST-HPV type 16 E6 (16E6) protein bound p53 with highest
     affinity, followed by GST-31E6, GST-18E6, and GST-11E6. The GST-E6 fusion
     proteins were sufficient for binding p53 purified from a baculovirus
     expression system as well as in vitro translation sources, while no
     association was observed with GST-18E7 or a GST-16E6 mutant bearing a
     five-amino-acid deletion in E6. When the site-specific DNA binding
     activity of p53 was examined in the presence of GST-E6 proteins, an
     inhibition of DNA binding was observed. The degree of inhibition
     correlated with the relative affinity of different E6 proteins for p53;
     thus, GST-16E6 was the most potent inhibitor of p53 DNA binding activity,
     and GST-11E6 was the least effective. Prevention of p53 DNA binding is
     likely to play a role in the abrogation of the transcriptional activity of
     p53 by HPV E6 and provides a further mechanism for E6 disruption of p53
     growth suppressor function in addition to its role in directing specific
     degradation of p53 through the ubiquitin-mediated pathway. The variation
     in inhibition of DNA binding seen with the various E6 proteins may thus
     contribute to the differences in oncogenic potential seen among the HPV
     types.

TI  - A complex of GRB2-dynamin binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin
     receptor substrate-1 after insulin treatment.
PG  - 3033-8
AB  - Insulin drives the formation of a complex between tyrosine-phosphorylated
     IRS-1 and SH2-containing proteins. The SH2-containing protein Grb2 also
     possesses adjacent SH3 domains, which bind the Ras guanine nucleotide
     exchange factor Sos. In this report, we examined the involvement of
     another SH3 binding protein, dynamin, in insulin signal transduction. SH3
     domains of Grb2 as GST fusion proteins bound dynamin from lysates of CHO
     cells expressing wild-type insulin receptor (IR) (CHO-IR cells) in a
     cell-free system (in vitro). Immunoprecipitation studies using specific
     antibodies against Grb2 revealed that Grb2 was co-immunoprecipitated with
     dynamin from unstimulated CHO-IR cells. After insulin treatment of CHO-IR
     cells, anti-dynamin antibodies co-immunoprecipitated the IR beta-subunit
     and IRS-1, as tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and PI 3-kinase activity.
     However, purified rat brain dynamin did not bind directly to either the
     IR, IRS-1 or the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase in vitro. Together, these
     results suggest that in CHO-IR cells, insulin stimulates the binding of
     dynamin to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 via Grb2 and that IRS-1 also
     associates with PI 3-kinase in response to insulin. This complex formation
     was reconstituted in vitro using recombinant baculovirus-expressed IRS-1,
     GST-Grb2 fusion proteins and dynamin peptides containing proline-rich
     sequences. Furthermore, dynamin GTPase activity was found to be stimulated
     when an IRS-1-derived phosphopeptide, containing the Grb2 binding site,
     was added to the dynamin-Grb2 complex in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

     mitochondrial SSBs.
PG  - 171-7
AB  - Little is known about the identity and involvement of single-stranded (ss)
     DNA-binding (SSB) and RNA-binding proteins in developmental processes that
     occur during oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster (Dm). Here, we describe
     a molecular approach designed to identify such proteins by virtue of their
     ssDNA-binding activity. We have constructed a directional ovarian cDNA
     library and conducted expression cloning screens which identified five
     unique cDNAs that encode proteins capable of binding ssDNA. All five
     represent previously unreported sequences. The remainder of this paper
     focuses on one of these cDNAs which encodes a Dm protein displaying
     significant sequence homology to Escherichia coli ssDNA-binding protein
     (SSB, involved in DNA replication, repair and recombination), as well as
     eukaryotic SSBs isolated from the mitochondria (mt) of rats, frogs, humans
     and yeast. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of this 15.6-kDa protein,
     which we will refer to as Dm mtSSB, displays average identities of 38.3%
     with eukaryotic mtSSBs and 23.4% with bacterial SSBs. Gel retardation
     analysis with an affinity-purified GST fusion protein confirms that Dm
     mtSSB specifically binds ss, but not double stranded DNA. Dm mtSSB is
     encoded by a nuclear gene whose expression appears to be developmentally
     regulated. It is expressed as a single 600-nucleotide (nt) transcript
     during oogenesis and embryogenesis. A larger transcript of 1500 nt is
     prevalent in some later stages of Dm development.

     interactions.
PG  - 511-21
AB  - Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase has an 85 kDa subunit (p85 alpha) which
     mediates its association with activated protein tyrosine kinase receptors
     through SH2 domains, and an 110 kDa subunit (p110) which has intrinsic
     catalytic activity. Here p85 alpha and a related protein p85 beta are
     shown to form stable complexes with recombinant p110 in vivo and in vitro.
     Using a panel of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of the
     inter-SH2 region of p85, 104 amino acids were found to bind directly the
     p110 protein, while deletion mutants within this region further defined
     the binding site to a sequence of 35 amino acids. Transient expression of
     the mutant p85 alpha protein in mouse L cells showed it was unable to bind
     PI 3-kinase activity in vivo. Mapping of the complementary site of
     interaction on the p110 protein defined 88 amino acids in the N-terminal
     region of p110 which mediate the binding of this subunit to either the p85
     alpha or the p85 beta proteins. The inter-SH2 region of p85 is predicted
     to be an independently folded module of a coiled-coil of two long
     anti-parallel alpha-helices. The predicted structure of p85 suggests a
     basis for the intersubunit interaction and the relevance of this
     interaction with respect to the regulation of the PI 3-kinase complex is
     discussed.

AB  - The isolation, characterization, and expression of a novel cDNA encoding a
     Trypanosoma cruzi polypeptide (TcAc2), homologous to various small stress
     proteins and glutathione S-transferases, are described. The deduced
     amino-acid sequence revealed two domains sharing 27% identity and an
     additional 27% similarity to each other suggesting that the molecule may
     have evolved from a single domain by a process of gene duplication and
     fusion. The TcAc2 cDNA was subcloned into the pGEX-2T vector for
     expression in E coli. In vitro translation products of epimastigote mRNA,
     immunoprecipitated with anti-TXepi serum, showed a major radioactive band
     of 52 kDa. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine labelled epimastigote
     and trypomastigote antigens after pulse chase experiments, using
     anti-TcAc2 fusion protein antibodies, showed that the protein is released
     into the culture medium. Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed a single
     band of 52 kDa with epimastigote, trypomastigote and amastigote antigens.
     Primary structure homology searches revealed that each TcAc2 domain
     contained within its N-terminus significant homology to Solanum tuberosum
     pathogenesis-related protein PR1, soybean heat shock protein 26-A, auxin
     regulated clone pCNT103 from Nicotiana tabacum and Drosophila melanogaster
     glutathione S-transferase 27 (GST27). This finding was supported by a
     comparison of hydrophobicity profiles of TcAc2 and these proteins. Most of
     them play a central role in protection mechanisms against stress. Based on
     the homology between TcAc2, glutathione S-transferases (GST) and small
     stress proteins, it is likely that the TcAc2 gene product may play a
     crucial role in parasite's adaptation to its microenvironment. These
     molecules could be considered as members of the GST superfamily, where the
     T cruzi protein may take a particular place because of its internal gene
     duplication.
