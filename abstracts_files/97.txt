TI  - Cell surface expression of an endoplasmic reticulum resident heat shock
     protein gp96 triggers MyD88-dependent systemic autoimmune diseases.
PG  - 15824-9
AB  - Heat shock proteins have been implicated as endogenous activators for
     dendritic cells (DCs). Without tissue distress or death, these
     intracellular molecules are inaccessible to surface receptor(s) on DCs,
     possibly to avoid uncontrolled DC activation and breakdown of immunologic
     tolerance. We herein addressed this hypothesis in transgenic mice by
     enforcing cell surface expression of gp96, a ubiquitous heat shock protein
     of the endoplasmic reticulum. Although a pan-specific promoter is used for
     transgene expression, neither the expression level nor the tissue
     distribution of the endogenous gp96 was altered by this maneuver. However,
     cell surface gp96 induced significant DC activations and spontaneous
     lupus-like autoimmune diseases, even though the development/functions of
     lymphocytic compartments were unaltered. Using a bone marrow chimera
     approach, we further demonstrated that both DC activation and autoimmunity
     elicited by cell surface gp96 are dependent on the downstream adaptor
     protein MyD88 for signaling by Toll/IL-1 receptor family. Our study not
     only established the proinflammatory property of cell surface gp96 in
     vivo, but also suggested a chronic stimulation of DCs by gp96 as a pathway
     to initiate spontaneous autoimmune diseases.

TI  - Toll-like receptor 2 pathway drives streptococcal cell wall-induced joint
     inflammation: critical role of myeloid differentiation factor 88.
PG  - 6145-53
AB  - The IL-1R/Toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily of receptors has a key role
     in innate immunity and inflammation. In this study, we report that
     streptococcal cell wall (SCW)-induced joint inflammation is predominantly
     dependent on TLR-2 signaling, since TLR-2-deficient mice were unable to
     develop either joint swelling or inhibition of cartilage matrix synthesis.
     Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a Toll/IL-1R domain
     containing adaptor molecule known to have a central role in both
     IL-1R/IL-18R and TLR signaling. Mice deficient for MyD88 did not develop
     SCW-induced arthritis; both joint swelling and disturbance of cartilage
     chondrocyte anabolic function was completely abolished. Local levels of
     proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in synovial tissue washouts were
     strongly reduced in MyD88-deficient mice. Histology confirmed the pivotal
     role of MyD88 in acute joint inflammation. TLR-2-deficient mice still
     allow influx of inflammatory cells into the joint cavity, although the
     number of cells was markedly reduced. No influx of inflammatory cells was
     seen in joints of MyD88-deficient mice. In addition, cartilage matrix
     proteoglycan loss was completely absent in MyD88 knockout mice. These
     findings clearly demonstrated that MyD88 is a key component in SCW-induced
     joint inflammation. Since agonists of the Toll-like pathway are abundantly
     involved in both septic and rheumatoid arthritis, targeting of MyD88 may
     be a novel therapy in inflammatory joint diseases.

PG  - 2717-26
AB  - In allergy and asthma, the fine balance between the T helper (Th) 1, Th2
     and T regulatory cytokine responses appears to be shifted towards Th2.
     Here, we report that synthetic lipopeptides which contain the typical
     lipid part of the lipoprotein of gram-negative bacteria stimulate a
     distinct regulatory cytokine pattern and inhibit several Th2 cell-related
     phenomena. The most potent analogue of synthetic lipopeptides, lipopeptide
     CGP 40774 (LP40) was not active in MyD88-deficient mice and stimulated
     Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, but not TLR-4. LP40 potentiated the production
     of IFN-gamma and IL-10, but not IL-4 and IL-5 by human T cells. In
     addition, triggering of TLR-2 by lipopeptides promoted the in vitro
     differentiation of naive T cells towards IL-10- and IFN-gamma-producing T
     cells and suppressed IL-4 production by Th2 cells. Accordingly, LP40
     inhibited IgE production induced by allergen, anti-IgD antibody,
     Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or murine acquired immunodeficiency virus.
     Furthermore, ovalbumin-induced lung eosinophilic inflammation was
     abolished and Schistosoma mansoni egg-induced granuloma size and
     eosinophil counts were suppressed in mice by LP40. These results
     demonstrate that stimulation of TLR-2 by lipopeptides represents a novel
     way for possible treatment of allergy and asthma by regulating the
     disrupted cytokine balance.

AB  - Roles for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are emerging in conditions such as
     sepsis syndrome, systemic lupus erythromatosis, rheumatoid arthritis and
     asthma, suggesting that the selective targeting of TLRs might be useful
     therapeutically. TLRs are defined by the presence of extracellular
     leucine-rich repeats and an intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor
     domain, and play a role in host defence and inflammation. Signalling
     pathways activated by TLRs show remarkable similarity to those activated
     by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (the receptor for which
     also has a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain), although adaptor proteins
     specific for certain TLRs are starting to emerge (e.g. Mal and Trif). The
     common signalling pathways used by all members of the TLR superfamily are
     being targeted, with drugs that block nuclear factor-kappaB and p38
     mitogen-activated protein kinase in clinical development for diseases such
     as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. As we learn more about TLR signal
     transduction, more options are presenting themselves for pharmacological
     targeting.

     autoimmunity.
PG  - 504-10
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: betaTC-tet (H2(k)) is a conditional insulinoma cell line
     derived from transgenic mice expressing a tetracycline-regulated oncogene.
     Transgenic expression of several proteins implicated in the apoptotic
     pathways increase the resistance of betaTC-tet cells in vitro. We tested
     in vivo the sensitivity of the cells to rejection and the protective
     effect of genetic alterations in NOD mice. METHODS: betaTC-tet cells and
     genetically engineered lines expressing Bcl-2 (CDM3D), a dominant negative
     mutant of MyD88 or SOCS-1 were transplanted in diabetic female NOD mice or
     in male NOD mice with diabetes induced by high-dose streptozotocin.
     Survival of functional cell grafts in NOD-scid mice was also analyzed
     after transfer of splenocytes from diabetic NOD mice. Autoreactive T-cell
     hybridomas and splenocytes from diabetic NOD mice were stimulated by
     betaTC-tet cells. RESULTS: betaTC-tet cells and genetically engineered
     cell lines were all similarly rejected in diabetic NOD mice and in
     NOD-scid mice after splenocyte transfer. In 3- to 6-week-old male NOD mice
     treated with high-dose streptozotocin, the cells temporarily survived, in
     contrast with C57BL/6 mice treated with high-dose streptozotocin
     (indefinite survival) and untreated 3- to 6-week-old male NOD mice
     (rejection). The protective effect of high-dose streptozotocin was lost in
     older male NOD mice. betaTC-tet cells did not stimulate autoreactive
     T-cell hybridomas, but induced IL-2 secretion by splenocytes from diabetic
     NOD mice. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The autoimmune process seems to play
     an important role in the destruction of betaTC-tet cells in NOD mice.
     Genetic manipulations intended at increasing the resistance of beta cells
     were inefficient. Similar approaches should be tested in vivo as well as
     in vitro. High dose streptozotocin influences immune rejection and should
     be used with caution.

PG  - 537-42
AB  - Inflammatory arthritis is associated with the release of a network of key
     cytokines. In T cell receptor transgenic K/BxN mice interleukin (IL)-1
     plays a key role in joint swelling and destruction, as suggested by the
     ability of anti-IL-1receptor (IL-1R) antibody treatment to delay the onset
     and slow the progression of this disease. This mechanism is dependent on
     the signaling pathway intermediary myeloid differentiation factor 88
     (MyD88), such that neither IL-1R nor MyD88-deficient mice developed
     visually detectable synovitis after transfer of arthritogenic sera. The
     Toll-like receptors (TLRs) share the same signaling pathway through MyD88
     as the IL-1R. The administration of a TLR-4 ligand, lipopolysaccharide,
     concomitant with arthritogenic serum in IL-1 receptor-deficient mice
     resulted in acute paw swelling, but not in MyD88-deficient mice. Also,
     serum transferred arthritis was not sustained in TLR-4 mutant mice
     compared with controls. These results suggest that innate immune functions
     via TLR-4 might perpetuate inflammatory mechanisms and bypass the need for
     IL-1 in chronic joint inflammation.

     recurrent thrombosis or fetal loss. The thrombophilic state has been
     partially related to the induction of a proinflammatory and procoagulant
     endothelial cell (EC) phenotype induced by anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I
     (beta(2)-GPI) antibodies that bind beta(2)-GPI expressed on the EC
     surface. Anti-beta(2)-GPI antibody binding has been shown to induce
     nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) translocation leading to a
     proinflammatory EC phenotype similar to that elicited by interaction with
     microbial products (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) and proinflammatory
     cytokines (interleukin 1 beta [IL-1 beta], tumor necrosis factor alpha
     [TNF-alpha]). However, the upstream signaling events are not characterized
     yet. To investigate the endothelial signaling cascade activated by
     anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies, we transiently cotransfected immortalized
     human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) with dominant-negative
     constructs of different components of the pathway (Delta TRAF2, Delta
     TRAF6, Delta MyD88) together with reporter genes (NF-kappa B luciferase
     and pCMV-beta-galactosidase). Results showed that both human
     anti-beta(2)-GPI IgM monoclonal antibodies as well as polyclonal
     affinity-purified anti-beta(2)-GPI IgG display a signaling cascade
     comparable to that activated by LPS or IL-1. Delta TRAF6 and Delta MyD88
     significantly abrogate antibody-induced as well as IL-1- or LPS-induced
     NF-kappa B activation, whereas Delta TRAF2 (involved in NF-kappa B
     activation by TNF) does not affect it. Moreover, anti- beta(2)-GPI
     antibodies and LPS followed the same time kinetic of IL-1
     receptor-activated kinase (IRAK) phosphorylation, suggesting an
     involvement of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family. Our findings
     demonstrate that anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies react with their antigen
     likely associated to a member of the TLR/IL-1 receptor family on the EC
     surface and directly induce activation.

PG  - 623-36
AB  - The intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (IK) channel is
     distinguished from the functionally related Ca2+-activated K+ channels of
     smaller and larger unitary conductance by its molecular structure,
     pharmacology, tissue distribution and physiology. Like many K+ channels,
     IK is an assembly of four identical subunits each spanning the membrane
     six times and each contributing equally to the K+ selectivity pore
     positioned centrally in the complex. The IK channel gains its high
     sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+ from tightly bound calmodulin, and its
     activity is independent of the membrane potential. Several toxins
     including charybdotoxin and the more selective mutant,
     Glu32-charybdotoxin, maurotoxin and stichodactyla toxin potently block IK
     channels. Among blockers of the IK channel are also several small organic
     molecules including the antimycotic clotrimazole and the close analogues
     TRAM-34 and ICA-17043, as well as the antihypertensive, nitrendipine. The
     IK channel is distributed in peripheral tissues, including secretory
     epithelia and blood cells, but it appears absent from neuronal and muscle
     tissue. An important physiological role of the IK channel is to help
     maintain large electrical gradients for the sustained transport of ions
     such as Ca2+ influx that controls T lymphocyte (T cell) proliferation. In
     this review, special attention is given to an analysis of the use of IK
     blockers as potential immunosuppressants for the treatment of autoimmune
     disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and
     multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) regulates lung
     innate immunity to lipopolysaccharide through Akt/Erk activation of
     NFkappa B and AP-1 in vivo.
PG  - 42808-14
AB  - The lung innate immune response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) coordinates
     cellular inflammation, mediator, and protease release essential for host
     defense but deleterious in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
     and cystic fibrosis. In vitro, LPS signals to the transcription factors
     NFkappaB via TLR4, MyD88, and IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK), to AP-1 by
     mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and via an alternate route in
     IRAK-deficient mice, but the in vivo lung signaling pathway(s) are not
     understood. We investigated the role of Akt and Erk1/2 as LPS intensely
     stimulates granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
     release, and neutralizing GM-CSF profoundly suppressed LPS-induced
     inflammation, suppressed expression and activity of lung proteases,
     significantly reduced GM-CSF and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)
     mRNA expression, and dampened nuclear localization of both NFkappaB
     (p50/65) and AP-1. LPS markedly activated Akt and Erk1/2, but not p38, in
     a GM-CSF-dependent manner in direct temporal association with NFkappaB and
     AP-1 activation. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt or Erk activation in
     LPS-treated tracheal explants ex vivo inhibited the release of GM-CSF.
     These data implicate GM-CSF-dependent activation of Akt in the
     amplification of this response and demonstrate the role of Erks rather
     than p38 in lung LPS inflammatory responses. Inhibition of GM-CSF may be
     of therapeutic benefit in inflammatory diseases in which LPS contributes
     to lung damage.

TI  - Chromatin-IgG complexes activate B cells by dual engagement of IgM and
     Toll-like receptors.
PG  - 603-7
AB  - Autoreactive B cells are present in the lymphoid tissues of healthy
     individuals, but typically remain quiescent. When this homeostasis is
     perturbed, the formation of self-reactive antibodies can have serious
     pathological consequences. B cells expressing an antigen receptor specific
     for self-immunoglobulin-gamma (IgG) make a class of autoantibodies known
     as rheumatoid factor (RF). Here we show that effective activation of RF+ B
     cells is mediated by IgG2a-chromatin immune complexes and requires the
     synergistic engagement of the antigen receptor and a member of the
     MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. Inhibitor studies
     implicate TLR9. These data establish a critical link between the innate
     and adaptive immune systems in the development of systemic autoimmune
     disease and explain the preponderance of autoantibodies reactive with
     nucleic acid-protein particles. The unique features of this
     dual-engagement pathway should facilitate the development of therapies
     that specifically target autoreactive B cells.

TI  - Novel signal transduction pathway utilized by extracellular HSP70: role of
     toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4.
PG  - 15028-34
AB  - Recent studies have initiated a paradigm shift in the understanding of the
     function of heat shock proteins (HSP). It is now clear that HSP can and do
     exit mammalian cells, interact with cells of the immune system, and exert
     immunoregulatory effects. We recently demonstrated that exogenously added
     HSP70 possesses potent cytokine activity, with the ability to bind with
     high affinity to the plasma membrane, elicit a rapid intracellular Ca(2+)
     flux, activate NF-kappaB, and up-regulate the expression of
     pro-inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes. Here for the first time, we
     report that HSP70-induced proinflammatory cytokine production is mediated
     via the MyD88/IRAK/NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway and that HSP70
     utilizes both TLR2 (receptor for Gram-positive bacteria) and TLR4
     (receptor for Gram-negative bacteria) to transduce its proinflammatory
     signal in a CD14-dependent fashion. These studies now pave the way for the
     development of highly effective pharmacological or molecular tools that
     will either up-regulate or suppress HSP70-induced functions in conditions
     where HSP70 effects are desirable (cancer) or disorders where HSP70
     effects are undesirable (arthritis and arteriosclerosis).

TI  - Selective blockade of T lymphocyte K(+) channels ameliorates experimental
     autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 13942-7
AB  - Adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (AT-EAE), a
     disease resembling multiple sclerosis, is induced in rats by myelin basic
     protein (MBP)-activated CD4(+) T lymphocytes. By patch-clamp analysis,
     encephalitogenic rat T cells stimulated repeatedly in vitro expressed a
     unique channel phenotype ("chronically activated") with large numbers of
     Kv1.3 voltage-gated channels (approximately 1500 per cell) and small
     numbers of IKCa1 Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (approximately 50-120 per
     cell). In contrast, resting T cells displayed 0-10 Kv1.3 and 10-20 IKCa1
     channels per cell ("quiescent" phenotype), whereas T cells stimulated once
     or twice expressed approximately 200 Kv1.3 and approximately 350 IKCa1
     channels per cell ("acutely activated" phenotype). Consistent with their
     channel phenotype, [(3)H]thymidine incorporation by MBP-stimulated
     chronically activated T cells was suppressed by the peptide ShK, a blocker
     of Kv1.3 and IKCa1, and by an analog (ShK-Dap(22)) engineered to be highly
     specific for Kv1.3, but not by a selective IKCa1 blocker (TRAM-34). The
     combination of ShK-Dap(22) and TRAM-34 enhanced the suppression of
     MBP-stimulated T cell proliferation. Based on these in vitro results, we
     assessed the efficacy of K(+) channel blockers in AT-EAE. Specific and
     simultaneous blockade of the T cell channels by ShK or by a combination of
     ShK-Dap(22) plus TRAM-34 prevented lethal AT-EAE. Blockade of Kv1.3 alone
     with ShK-Dap(22), but not of IKCa1 with TRAM-34, was also effective. When
     administered after the onset of symptoms, ShK or the combination of
     ShK-Dap(22) plus TRAM-34 greatly ameliorated the clinical course of both
     moderate and severe AT-EAE. We conclude that selective targeting of Kv1.3,
     alone or with IKCa1, may provide an effective new mode of therapy for
     multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Liposomes as possible carriers for lactoferrin in the local treatment of
     inflammatory diseases.
PG  - 559-64
AB  - Liposomes prepared from naturally occurring biodegradable and nontoxic
     lipids are good candidates for local delivery of therapeutic agents.
     Treatment of arthritis by intra-articular administration of
     anti-inflammatory drugs encapsulated in liposomes prolongs the residence
     time of the drug in the joint. We have previously shown that
     intra-articular injection of human lactoferrin (hLf), a glycoprotein that
     possesses anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities, into mice with
     collagen-induced arthritis reduces inflammation. We have now investigated
     the possibility of using liposome-entrapped hLf as a delivery system to
     prolong hLf retention at sites of local inflammation such as the
     rheumatoid joint. Entrapment of hLf in negatively charged liposomes
     enhanced its accumulation in cultured human synovial fibroblasts from
     rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, compared with positively charged
     formulations or free protein. However, in the presence of synovial fluid,
     positively charged liposomes with entrapped hLf were more stable than the
     negatively charged formulations. In vivo experiments in mice with
     collagen-induced arthritis showed that the positive liposomes were more
     efficient in prolonging the residence time of hLf in the inflamed joint as
     compared with other liposomes. Thus, the amount of hLf retained in the
     joint after 2 hr was 60% of the injected dose in the case of positive
     liposomes and only 16% for negative pH-sensitive liposomes. The results
     suggest that entrapment of hLf in positively charged liposomes may modify
     its pharmacodynamic profile and be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment
     of RA and other local inflammatory conditions.

     /interferon-gamma -mediated induction of nuclear factor kappa B-dependent
     nitrite production and apoptosis in beta cells.
PG  - 37672-8
AB  - Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease in which
     pancreatic islet beta cells are destroyed by a combination of
     immunological and inflammatory mechanisms. In particular, cytokine-induced
     production of nitric oxide has been shown to correlate with beta cell
     apoptosis and/or inhibition of insulin secretion. In the present study, we
     investigated whether the interleukin (IL)-1beta intracellular signal
     transduction pathway could be blocked by overexpression of dominant
     negative forms of the IL-1 receptor interacting protein MyD88. We show
     that overexpression of the Toll domain or the lpr mutant of MyD88 in
     betaTc-Tet cells decreased nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation
     upon IL-1beta and IL-1beta/interferon (IFN)-gamma stimulation. Inducible
     nitric oxide synthase mRNA accumulation and nitrite production, which
     required the simultaneous presence of IL-1beta and IFN-gamma, were also
     suppressed by approximately 70%, and these cells were more resistant to
     cytokine-induced apoptosis as compared with parental cells. The decrease
     in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion induced by IL-1beta and IFN-gamma
     was however not prevented. This was because these dysfunctions were
     induced by IFN-gamma alone, which decreased cellular insulin content and
     stimulated insulin exocytosis. These results demonstrate that IL-1beta is
     involved in inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression and induction
     of apoptosis in mouse beta cells but does not contribute to impaired
     glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, our data show that
     IL-1beta cellular actions can be blocked by expression of MyD88 dominant
     negative proteins and, finally, that cytokine-induced beta cell secretory
     dysfunctions are due to the action of IFN-gamma.

TI  - Design of a potent and selective inhibitor of the intermediate-conductance
     Ca2+-activated K+ channel, IKCa1: a potential immunosuppressant.
PG  - 8151-6
AB  - The antimycotic clotrimazole, a potent inhibitor of the
     intermediate-conductance calcium-activated K(+) channel, IKCa1, is in
     clinical trials for the treatment of sickle cell disease and diarrhea and
     is effective in ameliorating the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
     However, inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes by clotrimazole limits its
     therapeutic value. We have used a rational design strategy to develop a
     clotrimazole analog that selectively inhibits IKCa1 without blocking
     cytochrome P450 enzymes. A screen of 83 triarylmethanes revealed the
     pharmacophore for channel block to be different from that required for
     cytochrome P450 inhibition. The "IKCa1-pharmacophore" consists of a
     (2-halogenophenyl)diphenylmethane moiety substituted by an unsubstituted
     polar pi-electron-rich heterocycle (pyrazole or tetrazole) or a -CN group,
     whereas cytochrome P450 inhibition absolutely requires the imidazole ring.
     A series of pyrazoles, acetonitriles, and tetrazoles were synthesized and
     found to selectively block IKCa1. TRAM-34
     (1-[(2-chlorophenyl)diphenylmethyl]-1H-pyrazole) inhibits the cloned and
     the native IKCa1 channel in human T lymphocytes with a K(d) of 20-25 nM
     and is 200- to 1,500-fold selective over other ion channels. Using
     TRAM-34, we show that blocking IKCa1 in human lymphocytes, in the absence
     of P450-inhibition, results in suppression of mitogen-stimulated
     [(3)H]thymidine incorporation of preactivated lymphocytes with
     EC(50)-values of 100 nM-1 microM depending on the donor. Combinations of
     TRAM-34 and cyclosporin A are more effective in suppressing lymphocyte
     mitogenesis than either compound alone. Our studies suggest that TRAM-34
     and related compounds may hold therapeutic promise as immunosuppressants.

PG  - 238-42; discussion 242-5
AB  - Surgical delay is one method of enhancing the vascularity of the lower
     abdominal transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap. The
     outcome of 7 patients who underwent surgical delay (by ligating both
     superficial and deep inferior epigastric vessels bilaterally) a week prior
     to definitive TRAM flap elevation is described. Three patients were
     smokers, 3 were obese, and 1 was an asthmatic on medication. A
     satisfactory aesthetic result was achieved in all patients and the
     complications that occurred were minor. Two patients developed minor skin
     necrosis due to inadequate trimming of zone 4 on the contralateral side to
     the pedicle and there were 3 cases of fat necrosis, which occurred below
     Scarpa's fascia. Surgical delay is a useful technique of breast
     reconstruction. It allows the flap to be centered safely in the lower
     abdomen. In the high-risk patient, delay may prevent the need for
     microsurgery or the sacrifice of both recti.
