TI  - D2 and D4 dopamine receptor gene polymorphisms and personality traits in a
     young Korean population.
PG  - 44-9
AB  - The correlation between the D4 dopamine receptor gene (DRD4) and the D2
     dopamine receptor gene (DRD2) polymorphisms was investigated with
     personality traits. For this study, homogeneous population consisting of
     243 young alcohol- and drug-naive Koreans who were blood-unrelated with a
     mean age (+/-SD) of 13.87 (+/-0.30) years old was analyzed for the DRD4
     and the DRD2 polymorphisms with their personality trait by Temperament and
     character inventory (TCI). The association between Novelty seeking (NS)
     score and DRD4 long alleles was only observed among the female subjects (t
     = 2.11, P = 0.037), but not in the male counter part. Female subjects who
     carried the DRD2 less frequent alleles (TaqI A1, TaqI B1, and Intron6 1)
     showed higher RD4 scores (dependence vs. independence) of Reward
     dependence (RD) than those without these alleles (P < 0.05). There was no
     interaction between DRD4 and DRD2 on the personality traits. These
     results, thus, confirmed the previous findings in which the long repeats
     of the DRD4-exon III polymorphism are related to NS personality trait, and
     also suggested that the DRD2 less frequent alleles were also associated
     with the reward-dependent trait.

TI  - Olanzapine reduces craving for alcohol: a DRD4 VNTR polymorphism by
     pharmacotherapy interaction.
PG  - 1882-8
AB  - Separate investigations have suggested that olanzapine, a D4 antagonist,
     decreases craving after a priming dose of alcohol and that the DRD4
     variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism influences the
     expression of craving after a priming dose of alcohol. The present study
     tested the hypothesis that olanzapine may be differentially effective at
     reducing cue-elicited craving based on individual differences in DRD4 VNTR
     in a sample of heavy social drinkers. Participants were randomly assigned
     to receive olanzapine (5 mg) or a control medication (cyproheptadine, 4
     mg) prior to consuming three alcoholic drinks. Participants completed
     subjective measures of craving and euphoria after each drink. Participants
     who were homozygous or heterozygous for the 7 (or longer) repeat allele of
     the DRD4 VNTR were classified as DRD4 L, while the other participants were
     classified as DRD4 S. The findings indicated that olanzapine reduces
     craving for alcohol at baseline for both DRD4 S and DRD4 L individuals,
     but only reduces craving after exposure to alcohol cues and after a
     priming dose of alcohol for DRD4 L individuals.

TI  - Dopamine D 4 receptor gene polymorphism and extraversion revisited:
     results from the Munich gene bank project for alcoholism.
PG  - 429-35
AB  - In 1998 a gene bank project for association studies in alcoholism was
     initiated at the Psychiatric Hospital of Munich. The research instruments
     used were partly adopted from the US collaborative study of the genetics
     of alcoholism and include the family history assessment module (FHAM), the
     semi-structured interview for assessment of genetics in alcoholism (SSAGA)
     and a number of personality inventories such as the Zuckerman's
     sensation-seeking scale, the NEO Five factor inventory and the temperament
     and character inventory. Based on the examination of 181 alcoholic
     subjects, no association was found between Dopamine D4 receptor gene
     polymorphism and novelty-seeking or extraversion as assessed by the three
     personality inventories. These findings are in line with a number of more
     recent studies questioning the association between novelty-seeking and
     DRD4 dopamine receptor gene polymorphism. Possible implications of these
     findings are discussed.

TI  - The DRD4 VNTR polymorphism moderates craving after alcohol consumption.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - Recent research has suggested that alterations in mesolimbic dopamine
     neurotransmission are central to the development and expression of craving
     for alcohol. Because the D4 dopamine receptor gene, variable numbers of
     tandem repeats (DRD4 VNTR) polymorphism putatively expresses functional
     differences in dopamine receptors, the present study tested whether this
     polymorphism influences the effects of a priming dose of alcohol on
     craving. Participants consumed 3 alcoholic drinks or 3 control drinks and
     completed measures of craving after each drink. Participants who were
     homozygous or heterozygous for the 7 (or longer) repeat allele were
     classified as DRD4 L, whereas the other participants were classified as
     DRD4 S. Results suggested that DRD4 L participants demonstrated
     significantly higher craving after consumption of alcohol as compared with
     the control beverage.

TI  - Absence of dopamine D4 receptors results in enhanced reactivity to
     unconditioned, but not conditioned, fear.
PG  - 158-64
AB  - The prefrontal cortex receives a major dopaminergic input from the ventral
     tegmental area, which plays an important role in the integration of
     neuronal signals influencing behavioural responses to stressful
     environmental stimuli. The dopamine D4 receptor (D4R) is expressed at
     highest levels in the prefrontal cortex and is the predominant D2-like
     receptor localized in this brain area. To investigate the functional
     significance of D4Rs in dopamine-mediated responses we have analysed a
     strain of mice lacking this receptor subtype (Drd4-/-). Wild-type and
     Drd4-/- mice were challenged in two different approach/avoidance conflict
     paradigms: the elevated plus maze and the light/dark preference
     exploration test. By these behavioural measures Drd4-/- mice showed
     heightened avoidance to the more fear-provoking areas of each maze as
     demonstrated by reduced exploration of the open arms of the plus maze and
     longer latencies to explore the illuminated compartment of the light/dark
     shuttle box. These exaggerated avoidance behaviours were further enhanced
     by an additional handling stress but completely prevented by anxiolytic
     agents such as the benzodiazepine midazolam and ethanol. Although Drd4-/-
     mice displayed heightened anxiety, they exhibited normal ethanol
     preference and consumption in a two-bottle choice test. Learned fear
     responses evaluated by contextual, cued and instrumental fear-conditioning
     tests showed no difference between wild-type and Drd4-/- mice. Taken
     together these results indicate that the absence of D4Rs increases
     avoidance behaviour to unconditioned stimuli and does not impair
     behavioural reactions to Pavlovian fear-conditioning, suggesting that the
     D4R could play a key role in the dopaminergic modulation of cortical
     signals triggered by environmental stimuli.

TI  - The discovery of PD 89211 and related compounds: selective dopamine D4
     receptor antagonists.
PG  - 219-26
AB  - The dopamine (DA) D2 family of receptors consists of the D2, D3, and D4
     receptors. The DA D4 receptor is of interest as a target for drugs to
     treat schizophrenia based upon its high affinity for the atypical
     antipsychotic clozapine and its localization to the limbic and cortical
     regions of the brain. As part of a program to identify novel DA D4
     receptor antagonists, a high-volume screen using the Parke-Davis compound
     library was initiated. This led to the discovery of PD 89211
     (benzenemethanol,
     2-chloro-4-[4-[(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)methyl]-1-piperzinyl]) that displaced
     [3H]spiperone binding to hD4.2 with an affinity (Ki) of 3.7 nM. PD 89211
     exhibited high selectivity for the DA D4.2 receptor (> 800-fold) as
     compared to other hDA receptor subtypes, rat brain serotonin, and
     adrenergic receptors. In vitro, PD 89211 had D4 receptor antagonist
     activity reversing quinpirole-induced [3H]thymidine uptake in CHOpro5
     cells (IC50 = 2.1 nM). Limited structure-activity relationship (SAR)
     studies indicated that compounds with a 4-chloro-, 4-methyl-, and
     3-chloro- substituents on the phenyl ring retained high affinity for D4
     receptors, while those with a 4-methoxy- and no substituent had less
     affinity. While all clinically effective antipsychotics increase DA
     synthesis (DOPA accumulation) in rodents, PD 89211 did not increase DA
     synthesis in the DA-enriched striatum, indicating no effect on DA turnover
     and low propensity for exhibiting motor side effects. However, it did
     increase catecholamine synthesis in rat hippocampus, as did clozapine.
     Moreover, PD 89211 selectivity increased catecholamine synthesis in the
     hippocampus of wild type but not in mice lacking D4 receptors, suggesting
     that one function of D4 receptors may be to modulate DA/norepinephrine
     (NE) turnover in this brain area known to possess D4 receptors. The
     discovery of compounds like PD 89211 provides a tool to help in
     understanding the function of DA D4 receptors in the CNS.

     receptors blockade on the changes in the ventricular content of
     catecholamines in rats withdrawn from morphine. Rats were given morphine
     by subcutaneous (s.c.) implantation of morphine pellets for 5 days. On the
     eighth day, morphine withdrawal was induced by s.c. administration of
     naloxone (1 mg/kg), and rats were killed 30 min later. Pretreatment with
     SCH 23390 (dopamine D1, D5 receptor antagonist) 15 min prior to naloxone
     administration suppressed some the behavioural signs of morphine
     withdrawal, whereas eticlopride (dopamine D2, D3, D4 receptor antagonist)
     did not. In addition, biochemical analysis indicate that SCH 23390
     completely abolished the withdrawal-induced increase in noradrenaline and
     dopamine turnover in the right ventricle. By contrast, eticlopride did not
     block the hyperactivity of catecholaminergic neurons in the heart during
     morphine withdrawal. These data suggest that the hyperactivity of
     catecholaminergic neurons in the heart during morphine withdrawal is
     dependent upon D1 dopamine receptor activation. In addition, our results
     exclude the involvement of D2 dopamine receptors.

TI  - The activation of dopamine D4 receptors inhibits oxidative stress-induced
     nerve cell death.
PG  - 6069-76
AB  - Oxidative stress is thought to be the cause of nerve cell death in many
     CNS pathologies, including ischemia, trauma, and neurodegenerative
     disease. Glutamate kills nerve cells that lack ionotropic glutamate
     receptors via the inhibition of the cystine-glutamate antiporter x(c)(-),
     resulting in the inhibition of cystine uptake, the loss of glutathione,
     and the initiation of an oxidative stress cell death pathway. A number of
     catecholamines were found to block this pathway. Specifically, dopamine
     and related ligands inhibit glutamate-induced cell death in both clonal
     nerve cell lines and rat cortical neurons. The protective effects of
     dopamine, apomorphine, and apocodeine, but not epinephrine and
     norepinephrine, are antagonized by dopamine D4 antagonists. A dopamine D4
     agonist also protects, and this protective effect is inhibited by U101958,
     a dopamine D4 antagonist. Although the protective effects of some of the
     catecholamines are correlated with their antioxidant activities, there is
     no correlation between the protective and antioxidant activities of
     several other ligands. Normally, glutamate causes an increase in reactive
     oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular Ca(2+). Apomorphine partially
     inhibits glutamate-induced ROS production and blocks the opening of
     cGMP-operated Ca(2+) channels that lead to Ca(2+) elevation in the late
     part of the cell death pathway. These data suggest that the protective
     effects of apomorphine on oxidative stress-induced cell death are, at
     least in part, mediated by dopamine D4 receptors via the regulation of
     cGMP-operated Ca(2+) channels.

AB  - Given the spectacular advances of genetics during the last five years, it
     seems appropriate to revisit the important subject of genetics of
     alcoholism and substance abuse. In recent studies alcohol abuse was shown
     to have an hereditability of roughly 38%, whereas psychostimulant and
     opiate use exhibit hereditabilities of 11 to 45%. The hereditability of
     smoking was found to be around 50%. There is a strong comorbidity between
     alcoholism and smoking. More than 80% of alcoholics smoke cigarettes in
     the U.S.A. Other genetic methods such as linkage analysis, allele sharing
     methods, association studies and analysis of inbred, transgenic and
     gene-knockout rodents, have partially agreed in showing that the 5HT-1B
     serotonin receptor and the DRD1, DRD2 and DRD4 dopamine receptors, as well
     as the dopamine transporter DAT, play an important role in behaviors
     related to alcoholism and substance abuse. Some neurochemical markers, as
     for example monoamine oxidase and adenylate cyclase have also been
     implicated in addictive disorders. The aldehyde dehydrogenase allele
     ALDH2*2 has a protective effect against alcoholism. Two whole genome
     linkage studies have shown linkage to chromosomal regions that are in the
     proximity of the DRD4 dopamine receptor, the GABA receptor gene cluster
     and the alcohol dehydrogenase gene cluster.

     African--Americans.
PG  - 168-72
AB  - alpha(2) adrenergic receptors are activated by adrenaline and
     noradrenaline, and three subtypes (ie, A, B, C) have differential
     affinities for antagonists and medications. The alpha(2c) adrenergic
     receptor (ADRA2C), located on chromosome 4p16.3, is a candidate gene for
     schizophrenia because it binds clozapine, an atypical neuroleptic useful
     for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. In addition, ADRA2C binds clonidine
     which is prescribed for three psychiatric diseases. This report
     communicates the findings of the genetic scanning of this gene of very
     tough GC content. The complete coding sequences and splice junctions were
     scanned with [DOVAM]-S in 104 schizophrenics, and pilot probes of patients
     with alcoholism (41 patients), cocaine abuse (25 patients), puerperal
     psychosis (30 patients), attention deficient/hyperactivity disorder (25
     patients) and autism (25 patients). Six sequence variants were found,
     including five silent polymorphisms (allele frequencies 0.6--25%) and an
     in-frame deletion of a homologous repeat at nucleotides 967--978 (ie,
     TIDRU(1)). Genotyping of the normal two repeat unit of the Third
     Intracytoplasmic Domain Repeat Unit (TIDRU(2)) and the deleted variant
     (TIDRU(1)) revealed that TIDRU(1) had allelic frequencies of 39% (11/28)
     and 3.5% (6/172) in African-American and Caucasian schizophrenics,
     respectively, and it occurred with equal frequency in controls (44%, 31/70
     and 3.0%, 6/198). TIDRU(1) occurs at a location similar to the third
     intracytoplasmic 48-nucleotide repeat unit in the DRD4 that is associated
     with ADHD. Although these data do not suggest an association of TIDRU(1)
     with schizophrenia, additional studies are needed to see whether TIDRU(1)
     confers a clinical phenotype.

AB  - Both molecular genetic factors (the D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) and the D4
     dopamine receptor (DRD4) polymorphisms) and environmental influences of
     living in an alcoholic or nonalcoholic home on the personality traits of
     Extraversion and Neuroticism were assessed in drug-naive, young adolescent
     boys. There were no significant main effects of genetic or environmental
     factors on either Neuroticism or Extraversion as measured by the Junior
     Eysenck Personality Inventory (JEPI). However, a significant interaction
     between DRD2 (but not DRD4) alleles and environmental variables was
     observed on Extraversion. Specifically, children with the minor alleles of
     the DRD2 gene showed a significantly greater Extraversion score when
     living in an alcoholic than in a nonalcoholic home. In contrast, children
     with the major alleles of the DRD2 gene showed a trend in the opposite
     direction. Although the results are preliminary and pending replication,
     they nevertheless provide the first report of a specific gene-environment
     interaction involving a human personality trait.

TI  - Reward deficiency syndrome: genetic aspects of behavioral disorders.
PG  - 325-41
AB  - The dopaminergic and opioidergic reward pathways of the brain are critical
     for survival since they provide the pleasure drives for eating, love and
     reproduction; these are called 'natural rewards' and involve the release
     of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and frontal lobes. However, the same
     release of dopamine and production of sensations of pleasure can be
     produced by 'unnatural rewards' such as alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine,
     heroin, nicotine, marijuana, and other drugs, and by compulsive activities
     such as gambling, eating, and sex, and by risk taking behaviors. Since
     only a minority of individuals become addicted to these compounds or
     behaviors, it is reasonable to ask what factors distinguish those who do
     become addicted from those who do not. It has usually been assumed that
     these behaviors are entirely voluntary and that environmental factors play
     the major role; however, since all of these behaviors have a significant
     genetic component, the presence of one or more variant genes presumably
     act as risk factors for these behaviors. Since the primary
     neurotransmitter of the reward pathway is dopamine, genes for dopamine
     synthesis, degradation, receptors, and transporters are reasonable
     candidates. However, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, opioid, and
     cannabinoid neurons all modify dopamine metabolism and dopamine neurons.
     We have proposed that defects in various combinations of the genes for
     these neurotransmitters result in a Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) and
     that such individuals are at risk for abuse of the unnatural rewards.
     Because of its importance, the gene for the [figure: see text] dopamine D2
     receptor was a major candidate gene. Studies in the past decade have shown
     that in various subject groups the Taq I A1 allele of the DRD2 gene is
     associated with alcoholism, drug abuse, smoking, obesity, compulsive
     gambling, and several personality traits. A range of other dopamine,
     opioid, cannabinoid, norepinephrine, and related genes have since been
     added to the list. Like other behavioral disorders, these are
     polygenically inherited and each gene accounts for only a small per cent
     of the variance. Techniques such as the Multivariate Analysis of
     Associations, which simultaneously examine the contribution of multiple
     genes, hold promise for understanding the genetic make up of polygenic
     disorders.

TI  - Pharmacological characterization of dopamine receptors in the corpus
     allatum of Manduca sexta larvae.
PG  - 755-66
AB  - Dopamine receptors previously identified in corpora allata (CA) of Manduca
     sexta last instars on the basis of dopamine effects on JH (juvenile
     hormone)/JH acid biosynthesis and cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation, were
     characterized pharmacologically. For this study, a broad spectrum of
     agonists or antagonists of D1, D2, D3 or D4 dopamine receptors, together
     with the dopamine metabolite N-acetyl-dopamine, other neurotransmitters
     and their agonists/antagonists, were tested for their effects on gland
     activity and cAMP production. The lack of effect of other
     neurotransmitters supports the specificity of the effect of dopamine and
     the dopamine specificity of the receptors. Only the D2 receptor antagonist
     spiperone had a potent effect on JH biosynthesis and cAMP formation by CA
     taken on day 0 of the last stadium, when dopamine stimulates both
     activities and thus appears to be acting via a D1-like receptor. Several
     other D2 receptor antagonists, and D1, D2/D1 and D4,3/D2 receptor
     antagonists were less effective. Thus, the D1-like receptor of the Manduca
     CA appears to be distinct pharmacologically from vertebrate D1 receptors.
     By contrast, a number of D2 agonists/antagonists had a significant effect
     on JH acid biosynthesis and cAMP production by the CA from day 6 of the
     last stadium, when dopamine inhibits both activities and thus appears to
     be acting via a D2-like receptor. Certain D1-specific agonists/antagonists
     were equally effective. The Manduca D2-like receptor therefore bears some
     pharmacological resemblance to vertebrate D2 receptors. N-acetyl dopamine
     acted as a dopamine agonist with day 6 CA, the first identified function
     for an N-acetylated biogenic amine in insects. Dopamine was found to have
     the same differential affect on the formation of cAMP in homogenates of
     day 0 and day 6 brains as it did with CA, and in the same concentration
     range. Dopamine receptor agonists/antagonists affecting cAMP formation by
     day 0 and day 6 CA homogenates had similar effects with brain homogenates.
     By contrast, dopamine only stimulated cAMP formation by homogenates of day
     0 and day 6 abdominal or ventral nerve cord. These results suggest that
     D1- and D2-like dopamine receptors of Manduca are regionally as well as
     temporally localized.

     characterization of the rat dopamine D4 receptor.
PG  - 555-64
AB  - It has been difficult to observe functional coupling of the D4 receptor to
     second messenger systems and a robust functional assay system for this
     receptor is still lacking. In the present study, the rat dopamine D4
     receptor was cloned from rat retina. Sequence comparison revealed identity
     with the published sequence of Ashgari and co-workers, including the two
     amino acid insertions (V-Q) at position 92 which are not present in the
     published sequence of O'Malley and coworkers. The rat dopamine D4 receptor
     was stably expressed in Chinese hamster lung fibroblast CCL39 cells.
     [3H]spiperone saturation binding yielded a Bmax of 2,370+/-546 fmol/mg
     protein and a pKD of 8.74+/-0.14 (n=4). Forskolin-stimulated cAMP
     accumulation was inhibited by dopamine (Emax 61+/-1% inhibition of
     forskolin-stimulated levels, pEC50 7.33+/-0.06, n=23). A similar
     concentration-dependent inhibition was observed with the dopamine D2-like
     receptor agonists quinpirole and 7-OH-DPAT which elicited nearly the same
     Emax as dopamine. By contrast, apomorphine and a number of compounds with
     reported affinity for human dopamine D4 receptors (PD168077, U-101958, SDZ
     GLC 756, L-745,870 and NGD 94-1) behaved as partial agonists (Emax ranging
     between 26% and 56% of that of dopamine). The agonist effect of dopamine
     was completely blocked by preincubation with pertussis toxin, no further
     accumulation of cAMP above the forskolin-stimulated levels being observed.
     Antagonist pKB-values obtained against dopamine in this system were:
     8.55+/-0.19 (n=3) for the partial agonist L-745,870, 8.38+/-0.23 (n=5) for
     spiperone, 7.18+/-0.17 (n=4) for haloperidol, 7.04+/-0.13 (n=4) for
     clozapine and <6 for raclopride. Other functional assays applicable were
     stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding, extracellular acidification rate
     and a serum-responsive element using luciferase expression as a reporter
     gene. However, the receptor did not couple to phosphatidylinositol
     turnover or to intracellular Ca2+. Thus, expression of the rat dopamine D4
     receptor in CCL39 cells provided several functional assay systems, of
     which inhibition of cAMP appeared to be the most robust one. These
     functional models can be used to evaluate the activity of compounds at the
     rat dopamine D4 receptor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The dopaminergic system may be involved in the development of
     alcoholism. As part of our ongoing studies on the association between
     alcoholism and dopaminergic genes, we report herein a mutation analysis of
     the 14-3-3 eta chain gene (YWHAH) and an association study between
     alcoholism and the YWHAH and dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4)
     polymorphisms. METHODS: Nucleotide mutations were investigated using
     single-strand conformation polymorphism methods. Associations were
     analyzed using a case-control design involving 185 Japanese alcoholics and
     286 Japanese controls. RESULTS: Five polymorphisms, -147G>A,
     -134(GCCTGCA)2-4, IVS1+31(G)7-8, IVS1+73-74ins(G), and 753A>G, were
     detected on the YWHAH, and three of them were novel. No significant
     associations were found between alcoholism and these polymorphisms or two
     additional polymorphisms on DRD4 exon III and DRD4 -521C/T. CONCLUSIONS:
     YWHAH and DRD4 do not appear to play a major role in the development of
     alcoholism.

TI  - Comparative pharmacological and functional analysis of the human dopamine
     D4.2 and D4.10 receptor variants.
PG  - 561-8
AB  - The human dopamine D4 receptor is a D2-like receptor which is a target for
     most common neuroleptics. Previous investigations have shown that this
     receptor displays a large polymorphic variation in the third intracellular
     loop involving a variable number of direct imperfect tandem repeats (VNTR)
     of 16 amino acids. The shortest and longest repeat variants reported to
     date contain two and 10 repeat units (D4.2 and D4.10). No major
     pharmacological differences have been reported for the most common
     variants of this receptor (D4.2, D4.4 and D4.7), although the D4.7 was
     reported by us to display a slightly lower potency for dopamine in
     functional assays. Direct pharmacological and functional comparison of the
     longest and shortest variants in this study suggest no major discrepancies
     in pharmacological or functional profile between both receptors. Both
     receptors display, on average, a 15-fold and 90-fold lower potency for
     epinephrine and norepinephrine, respectively, compared with dopamine. We
     observed small increases in functional potency and affinity for dopamine
     and quinpirole at the D4.10 receptor variant compared with the D4.2
     receptor. Our data indicate that there is no direct relationship between
     the length of the polymorphism and changes in pharmacology or functional
     activity. These findings are a suitable caution against the arbitrary
     pooling of D4 receptor VNTR genotypes in genetic studies, based on length.

PG  - 676-85
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate two polymorphisms near
     the D2 receptor gene (TaqI A RFLP and C microsatellite) and a VNTR for D4.
     A nonparametric linkage (NPL) technique, SIBPAL, was used to test for the
     presence or absence of linkage in 54 multiplex alcoholic families. These
     families had been ascertained through two alcoholic proband siblings in
     order to increase the density of alcoholic cases within these pedigrees.
     Phenotypic definitions of alcoholism were manipulated in an effort to
     determine the impact of severity (signs of physical dependence, early age
     of onset, presence of antisocial personality disorder) on the likelihood
     of finding positive evidence for linkage. A regression analysis that
     simultaneously evaluated the allele sharing identical by descent for
     Feighner criteria alcoholism in affected, unaffected, and discordant sib
     pairs (SIBPAL) for two D2 polymorphisms and the D4 polymorphism gave no
     evidence for linkage. Phenotypes associated with greater alcoholism
     severity (presence of physical dependence symptoms, earlier onset, or
     comorbid antisocial personality disorder) revealed some evidence for
     linkage. The presence of one or more physical dependence symptoms in
     combination with Feighner criteria alcoholism provided some evidence
     favoring linkage (TaqI A and D4). Alcoholics with an earlier onset of
     alcoholism showed some evidence for linkage especially when the presence
     of physical dependence was required (e. g., morning drinking, wanted to
     stop drinking but could not, binges or benders, and evidence of withdrawal
     symptoms). Finally, alcoholics with antisocial personality disorder
     differed significantly in their allele sharing from nonalcoholics for both
     D2 polymorphisms. Am. J. Med. Genet. (Neuropsychiatr. Genet.) 88:676-685,

PG  - 634-41
AB  - Activation of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway appears to promote drug- and
     alcohol-seeking behavior in laboratory animals. Results for association
     and linkage analysis between various alcohol dependence phenotypes and the
     dopamine receptors have been quite mixed. Similarly, both positive and
     negative results have been presented concerning dopamine receptor genes
     and temperament. Cloninger has postulated that the novelty seeking factor
     from the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) may be related to
     the dopamine neurotransmitter system. As novelty seeking is a trait of
     some importance for substance-dependent individuals, our goal was to test
     this relationship within a sample of families of alcoholics. No evidence
     favoring linkage between D2, D4, or DAT1 was found for TPQ novelty
     seeking. However, the harm-avoidance trait from the TPQ showed evidence
     for linkage to both the D4 and one of the D2 loci (TaqI A). The
     Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) was used to provide
     converging evidence for these results. The TPQ harm-avoidance scale loads
     heavily on introversion (worry, pessimism, shyness), characteristics that
     may be especially salient in alcoholic families. Thus, planned comparisons
     were made between selected MPQ traits measuring the affective dimension
     (negative affectivity, stress reaction, alienation, and well-being). We
     find evidence favoring linkage between the D2 and D4 receptor loci and
     these MPQ traits, with stronger evidence being seen for the D2
     polymorphisms. Am. J. Med. Genet. (Neuropsychiatr. Genet.) 88:634-641,

     alcoholics.
PG  - 139-43
AB  - The presence of the seven-repeat allele of the VNTR in the exon 3 of the
     dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) has been associated in healthy subjects
     to the personality trait of novelty seeking. The present study focuses
     these observations on a sample of Brazilian male alcoholics, evaluated on
     the temperament dimensions originally described by Cloninger. The
     genotypes observed are in agreement with those expected under
     Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Subjects with the seven-repeat allele manifest
     lower harm avoidance scores. No significant differences between subjects
     with or without the seven-repeat allele in the scores of novelty seeking
     or reward dependence were observed. The lack of association between
     novelty seeking and the DRD4 exon 3 polymorphism is further corroborated
     by the fact that the comorbid antisocial personality disorder is not
     associated to the presence of the seven-repeat allele. These results could
     be explained by a biological connection between the personality dimensions
     of novelty seeking and harm avoidance.

AB  - To determine the role of genes in the chromosomal regions 11p15 and 4p12
     in the development of alcohol dependence, a sample of alcoholics (n = 133)
     and normal controls (n = 89) were screened using polymorphisms in the
     dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and GABA receptor
     beta1 (GABRbeta1) genes. Comparison of total alcoholics with normal
     controls for GABRbeta1 gene was highly significant (p = 0.004). The
     difference between type II alcoholics and normal controls for the same
     allele frequencies was also significant (p = 0.029). The allele
     distributions of the polymorphisms in the DRD4 and TH genes in alcoholics
     and normal controls were similar and their differences were not
     significant. Our association studies indicate that the GABRbeta1 gene may
     play a role in the development of alcoholism. Therefore, it is important
     to screen a sample of well-characterized alcoholics with functional
     polymorphisms in all of the GABAalpha receptor subunit genes and determine
     their relationship with alcoholism phenotypes. Results with TH and DRD4
     genes indicate that these two genes may not play major roles in the
     development of alcoholism.

TI  - Clozapine's effects on ethanol's motivational properties.
PG  - 1377-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although dopamine D1 and D2 receptors have been implicated in
     ethanol's motivational effects, little is known about the contribution of
     dopamine D4 receptors. The present experiments examined the effects of
     clozapine, a dopamine D4 receptor antagonist, on ethanol's aversive,
     rewarding, stimulant, and reinforcing properties. METHODS: For taste
     conditioning, adult male Swiss-Webster mice received five conditioning
     trials consisting of 1-hr access to 0.2 M NaCl. After NaCl access on
     trials 1-4, subjects received clozapine (0, 1, or 2 mg/kg) followed 30 min
     later by 0, 2, or 4 g/kg ethanol. For place conditioning, Swiss-Webster
     mice received six pairings of a tactile stimulus with ethanol (2 g/kg,
     intraperitoneally), clozapine (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) + ethanol, or
     clozapine alone. Locomotor activity in a 30-min test was determined in
     Swiss-Webster mice receiving 0, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg clozapine and 0, 1, or 2
     g/kg ethanol. In a drinking study, separate groups of adult male C57BL/6J
     mice were allowed 30-min access to either 10% v/v ethanol mixed in 10% w/v
     sucrose or 10% sucrose without ethanol. During testing, both groups were
     given 0 or 1 mg/kg clozapine 30 min before fluid access. RESULTS: Ethanol
     flavor pairings during taste conditioning reduced subsequent flavor
     intakes, indicating the development of conditioned taste aversion.
     Clozapine reduced the magnitude of 4 g/kg ethanol-conditioned aversion
     only on trial 4 at the 2 mg/kg dose. Conditioned place preference for the
     ethanol-paired stimulus was not altered by clozapine. Clozapine alone did
     not produce either conditioned preference or aversion. Ethanol-stimulated
     activity was reduced by clozapine treatment. However, clozapine alone did
     not alter locomotor activity levels. Clozapine reduced sucrose consumption
     but did not alter ethanol/sucrose intake. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest
     that clozapine influences a limited range of ethanol-motivated behaviors.
     Specifically, dopamine D4 receptors appear important for ethanol's
     stimulant effect and possibly ethanol aversion, but not ethanol reward and
     reinforcement.

TI  - Dopamine D4 receptor gene: novelty or nonsense?
PG  - 3-16
AB  - Although the role of genetics in personality has been studied extensively
     at a phenomenological level, only lately has the investigation of specific
     genes been performed. Recent reports suggest that DNA variants of the
     dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) are associated with the personality trait
     of novelty seeking; however, others fail to replicate this finding. Such
     conflicting results suggest either a weak effect, an association only in
     certain populations, or a false-positive resulting from population
     stratification. We provide a critical analysis of genetic studies of DRD4
     variants with novelty seeking, alcoholism, drug abuse, and attention
     deficit hyperactivity disorder. Evidence for the role of DRD4 in novelty
     seeking is inconclusive, with a number of methodological concerns. Use of
     more conservative statistical criteria for significance, employing gene
     haplotypes, as well as linkage disequilibrium studies, are recommended.
     The molecular biology of the D4 gene is also reviewed.

TI  - Dopamine activation of endogenous cannabinoid signaling in dorsal
     striatum.
PG  - 358-63
AB  - We measured endogenous cannabinoid release in dorsal striatum of freely
     moving rats by microdialysis and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
     Neural activity stimulated the release of anandamide, but not of other
     endogenous cannabinoids such as 2-arachidonylglycerol. Moreover,
     anandamide release was increased eightfold over baseline after local
     administration of the D2-like (D2, D3, D4) dopamine receptor agonist
     quinpirole, a response that was prevented by the D2-like receptor
     antagonist raclopride. Administration of the D1-like (D1, D5) receptor
     agonist SKF38393 had no such effect. These results suggest that functional
     interactions between endocannabinoid and dopaminergic systems may
     contribute to striatal signaling. In agreement with this hypothesis,
     pretreatment with the cannabinoid antagonist SR141716A enhanced the
     stimulation of motor behavior elicited by systemic administration of
     quinpirole. The endocannabinoid system therefore may act as an inhibitory
     feedback mechanism countering dopamine-induced facilitation of motor
     activity.

TI  - Dopamine D4-like binding sites labeled by [3H]nemonapride include
     substantial serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in primate cerebral cortex.
PG  - 367-70
AB  - Dopamine D4-like binding sites are abundant in human cerebral cortex as
     detected by [3H]nemonapride. The extremely low density of D4 mRNA in human
     cerebral cortex is inconsistent with the high amount of D4-like binding
     sites. To investigate the nature of the D4-like receptors, [3H]nemonapride
     binding sites in the nonhuman primate cerebral cortex were characterized.
     Although [3H]nemonapride binding sites were D4-like, displaceable by
     clozapine but not raclopride, [3H]nemonapride binding was not displaced by
     selective D4 antagonists but was displaced by the selective 5-HT2A
     antagonist MDL100907. Using [3H]ketanserin as a 5-HT2A ligand, nemonapride
     showed high affinity for monkey (Ki = 10.4 nM) and cloned human (Ki = 9.4
     nM) 5-HT2A receptors, while its affinity for rat receptors was lower (Ki =
     140 nM). The present study demonstrates that cerebral cortical D4-like
     binding sites labeled by [3H]nemonapride in nonhuman primates consist of a
     very small portion of D4, but a substantial portion of 5-HT2A receptors.
     The unexpectedly high affinity of nemonapride for primate 5-HT2A receptor
     suggests reconsidering previous data from other studies using
     [3H]nemonapride, particularly those on D4-like receptors.

PG  - 188-203
AB  - Recent advances in molecular biology have resulted in a number of
     genetically manipulated mice with defined changes at dopamine receptor and
     the dopamine transporter (DAT) loci. Mice with targeted mutations at the
     D1 receptor (D1R) are growth-retarded and show downregulated expression of
     dynorphin and substance P. Behavioral assessment indicates that mutants
     have deficiencies in spatial learning and initiating movement, as well as
     in responding to novel stimuli. D1R mutants do not become locomotor
     activated with cocaine or show upregulated immediate early gene (IEG)
     expression, but D2 receptor-dependent IEG changes are intact. Acute
     cocaine administration increases substance P levels, suggesting that
     striatal expression of this neuropeptide can be modulated by
     D1R-independent processes. Failure of locomotor activation is also seen
     with repeated amphetamine treatment. Surprisingly, D1R-deficient mice
     retain cocaine-conditioned place preference. In contrast, D2 receptor
     knockout mice are bradykinetic, show increased striatal enkephalin
     expression and an absence of opiate rewarding effects. D3 receptor mutants
     are hyperactive when assessed in an exploratory assay and display reduced
     anxiety-associated behavior in an elevated plus maze test. The recently
     described D4 receptor homozygous mutants exhibit a reduction in baseline
     locomotor activity and were shown to be supersensitive to the locomotor
     activating effects of alcohol and psychostimulant drugs. As expected, DAT
     knockout mice are hyperactive and do not respond to cocaine or
     amphetamine. The observation that D2 and D4 dopamine receptor and DAT
     mutants show compensatory effects, together with the complicating issue of
     their hybrid genetic background may temper conclusions regarding the
     direct effects of the targeted mutation on phenotype.

TI  - Dopamine inhibits vasopressin-dependent cAMP production in the rat
     cortical collecting duct.
PG  - F62-7
AB  - Dopamine inhibits Na+ and water reabsorption in the rat cortical
     collecting duct (CCD) in the presence of arginine vasopressin (AVP). This
     inhibition appears to involve the D4 dopamine receptor isoform, which
     inhibits cAMP production; however, the D1A receptor, which stimulates cAMP
     production, is also expressed in the CCD. To discriminate between these
     opposing effects, we measured cAMP production in intact CCD segments. The
     basal rate of cAMP production ranged from 6.5 to 10 fmol/mm of tubule
     length over a 7-min incubation period, and it was unaffected by either
     dopamine or the D1A-specific agonist fenoldopam. AVP increased cAMP
     production to the range of 85-153 fmol . mm-1 . 7 min-1. Whereas neither
     0.1 nor 1.0 microM fenoldopam affected AVP-dependent cAMP production,
     dopamine reduced it in a dose-dependent manner, achieving a maximum
     inhibition of 50% at 10 microM. This effect was reversed by the D4
     receptor antagonist clozapine but not by pimozide or spiperone
     (antagonists of D2 and D3 receptors) or by calphostin C or chelerythrine
     (inhibitors of protein kinase C). We conclude that dopamine inhibits
     transepithelial Na+ transport and osmotic water permeability in the
     presence of AVP by inhibition of cAMP production, which is mediated by the
     D4 receptor isoform linked via the inhibitory G protein Gi.

TI  - D2 and D4 dopamine receptor polymorphisms and personality.
PG  - 257-67
AB  - The relationship of various dimensions of temperament, measured by the
     Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ), to polymorphisms of the D2
     dopamine receptor (DRD2) and D4 dopamine receptor (DRD4) genes was
     determined in 119 healthy Caucasian boys who had not yet begun to consume
     alcohol and other drugs of abuse. Total Novelty Seeking score of the TPQ
     was significantly higher in boys having, in common, all three minor (A1,
     B1, and Intron 6 1) alleles of the DRD2 compared to boys without any of
     these alleles. Boys with the DRD4 7 repeat (7R) allele also had a
     significantly higher Novelty Seeking score than those without this allele.
     However, the greatest difference in Novelty Seeking score was found when
     boys having all three minor DRD2 alleles and the DRD4 7R allele were
     contrasted to those without any of these alleles. Neither the DRD2 nor the
     DRD4 polymorphisms differentiated total Harm Avoidance score. Whereas
     subjects having all three minor DRD2 alleles had a significantly higher
     Reward Dependence 2 (Persistence) score than subjects without any of these
     alleles, no significant difference in this personality score was found
     between subjects with and without the DRD4 7R allele. In conclusion, DRD2
     and DRD4 polymorphisms individually associate with Novelty Seeking
     behavior. However, the combined DRD2 and DRD4 polymorphisms contribute
     more markedly to this behavior than when these two gene polymorphisms are
     individually considered.

TI  - Evidence for genetic linkage to alcohol dependence on chromosomes 4 and 11
     from an autosome-wide scan in an American Indian population.
PG  - 216-21
AB  - To identify specific genes affecting vulnerability or resistance, we
     performed a whole-autosomal genome scan for genetic linkage to alcohol
     dependence in a Southwestern American Indian tribe. Genotypes at 517
     autosomal microsatellite loci and clinical evaluations were available for
     152 subjects belonging to extended pedigrees and forming 172 sib-pairs.
     Highly suggestive evidence for linkage emerged for two genomic regions
     using two- and multipoint sib-pair regression methods; both regions
     harbored neurogenetic candidate genes. The best evidence is seen with
     D11S1984 (nominal P = 0.00007, lod approximately equal to 3.1) on
     chromosome 11p, in close proximity to the DRD4 dopamine receptor and
     tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) genes. Good evidence is seen with D4S3242
     (nominal P = 0.0002, lod approximately equal to 2.8) on chromosome 4p,
     near the beta1 GABA receptor gene. Interestingly, three loci in the
     alcohol dehydrogenase gene cluster on chromosome 4q showed evidence for
     linkage with two-point analyses, but not multipoint analysis.

PG  - 146-50
AB  - Multiple genetic polymorphisms of the human dopamine D4 receptor (hD4R)
     have been identified including a 12 bp repeat in exon 1 associated with a
     psychotic condition called delusional disorder. Competition binding assays
     revealed minor pharmacological differences between the recombinant A1
     (normal) and A2 (delusional) proteins with respect to quinpirole and the
     antipsychotic clozapine, however no functional differences were detected
     for receptor activation by dopamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Our
     results suggest that this polymorphism may only confer susceptibility to
     delusional disorder in combination with other genetic or environmental
     factors.

TI  - No association between novelty seeking and the type 4 dopamine receptor
     gene (DRD4) in two New Zealand samples.
PG  - 98-101
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 1986 and 1987, Cloninger postulated the existence of the
     heritable behavioral trait of novelty seeking and its putative
     underpinnings in the dopaminergic systems of the ventral midbrain. Two
     widely reported studies found significant associations between novelty
     seeking and the type 4 dopamine receptor gene (DRD4), although a more
     recent study did not. The authors' objective was to investigate this
     association in two New Zealand samples. METHOD: The authors studied two
     nonoverlapping samples: subjects in a depression treatment trial (N = 86)
     and subjects from 14 pedigrees dense with alcoholism (N = 181). DRD4
     genotyping was based on a standard protocol. RESULTS: Novelty seeking and
     DRD4 were not statistically associated. CONCLUSIONS: In these samples,
     there was no suggestion that the DRD4 polymorphism contributed to
     individual differences in the behavioral trait of novelty seeking.

     dependence' on ethanol.
PG  - 221-9
AB  - The steady-state levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) of five cloned dopamine
     (D) receptors were measured in five brain regions in rats in a recently
     developed animal model of 'behavioral dependence' on ethanol. One group of
     rats was given the choice between ethanol and water over a 9-month period
     and developed 'behavioral dependence' on ethanol (group a). This group was
     compared with a group given the choice between ethanol and water for only
     2 months (not yet behaviorally dependent, group b), a group forced to
     consume ethanol as sole fluid over a 9-month period (not behaviorally
     dependent, group c) and ethanol-naive control rats. All groups were
     sacrificed 1 month after ethanol withdrawal. The concentrations of mRNA of
     D3-receptors in the limbic forebrain (which included the nucleus
     accumbens) were significantly lowered in groups a and b, but unchanged in
     group c. D3 mRNA levels were reduced in the hippocampus of group b and
     unchanged in the cortex, amygdala and striatum. No significant changes in
     the mRNA concentrations of D1-, D2-, D4- or D5-receptors were seen in the
     five brain regions in any group. In conclusion, chronic consumption of
     ethanol under the 'free-choice condition', which may best induce the
     drug-rewarding effect, leads to specific changes in the D3-receptor gene
     expression which were not seen after forced ethanol administration.
     Changes in D3 mRNA levels were, however, not a specific correlate of
     'behavioral dependence', as they were also detected in rats not yet
     'behaviorally dependent' (group b).

     alcoholics.
PG  - 483-7
AB  - A dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotansmission has been implicated in
     alcohol-seeking behavior. Recently, a significant association between the
     seven-repeat allele (DRD4*7R) of a 16 amino acid motif in the third exon
     of the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) and the personality trait of
     novelty seeking has been reported. Our population-based association study
     tested the hypothesis that the DRD4*7R variant predisposes to high levels
     of novelty seeking, which may underlie alcohol-seeking behavior. The
     genotypes of the expressed DRD4 exon III polymorphism were determined in
     197 German controls and 252 German alcohol-dependent males, of whom 92
     alcoholics completed the tridimensional personality questionnaire. We
     found no significant differences in the DRD4*7R frequencies between
     controls and alcoholics, including two subgroups (56 alcoholics with
     dissocial personality disorder according to ICD-10 and 89 alcoholics with
     severe withdrawal symptoms) with a high level of novelty seeking. The
     novelty-seeking scores did not differ significantly between alcoholics
     (including both subgroups) carrying long alleles with six or more repeats
     compared with those lacking long alleles. The present results do not
     provide evidence that the DRD4*7R allele contributes a common and relevant
     effect to alcohol-seeking behavior in our sample of alcoholics.

TI  - Mice lacking dopamine D4 receptors are supersensitive to ethanol, cocaine,
     and methamphetamine.
PG  - 991-1001
AB  - The human dopamine D4 receptor (D4R) has received considerable attention
     because of its high affinity for the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and
     the unusually polymorphic nature of its gene. To clarify the in vivo role
     of the D4R, we produced and analyzed mutant mice (D4R-/-) lacking this
     protein. Although less active in open field tests, D4R-/- mice
     outperformed wild-type mice on the rotarod and displayed locomotor
     supersensitivity to ethanol, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Biochemical
     analyses revealed that dopamine synthesis and its conversion to DOPAC were
     elevated in the dorsal striatum from D4R-/- mice. Based on these findings,
     we propose that the D4R modulates normal, coordinated and drug-stimulated
     motor behaviors as well as the activity of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons.

AB  - The neurochemistry of Parkinson's disease and other degenerative
     parkinsonisms is reviewed, emphasizing the changes described in the
     dopaminergic system. Presynaptic dopaminergic markers are reduced over the
     striatum in all these degenerative parkinsonisms, dopamine receptor
     changes being more heterogeneous. While in Parkinson's disease D1 and D2
     receptors remain preserved as compared to controls, in progressive
     supranuclear palsy there is a loss of nigral D1 receptors and of striatal
     D2 receptors. This finding has also been described in striatonigral
     degeneration. There are no clear data about the status of D3, D4 and D5
     dopamine receptors in these conditions. The alterations in other
     neurotransmission systems, cholinegic, adrenergic, serotoninergic and
     peptidergic are, in general, less dramatic, although they have not been
     studied in detail. To conclude, further studies are necessary in these
     field, in these moment, however, the preservation of striatal D2 dopamine
     receptors is the neurochemical finding with the best correlation with the
     response to levodopa or other dopaminergic agonists.

TI  - Activation of type II adenylate cyclase by D2 and D4 but not D3 dopamine
     receptors.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - The D2-like dopamine receptors couple to a variety of signal transduction
     pathways, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, mitogenesis, and
     activation of potassium channels. Although these effects are mediated via
     pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, G(i/o), it is likely that some of
     these effects are influenced by the release of G protein betagamma
     subunits. Type II adenylate cyclase (ACII) is highly regulated by multiple
     biochemical stimuli, including protein kinase C, forskolin, G protein
     alpha subunits, and G protein betagamma subunits. The ability of betagamma
     subunits to activate this enzyme in the presence of activated alpha(s) has
     been particularly well characterized. Although stimulation by betagamma
     subunits has been described as conditional on the presence of activated
     alpha(s), betagamma subunits also potentiate ACII activity after
     activation of protein kinase C. We created stable cell lines expressing
     ACII and the D2L receptor, the D3 receptor, or the D4.4 receptor.
     Activation of D2L or D4.4 receptors, but not D3 receptors, potentiated
     beta-adrenergic receptor/Gs-stimulated activity of ACII, as measured by
     the intracellular accumulation of cAMP. Similarly, stimulation of D2L or
     D4.4 receptors potentiated phorbol ester-stimulated ACII activity in the
     absence of activated alpha(s), whereas stimulation of D3 receptors did
     not. The effect of D2-like receptor stimulation was blocked by
     pretreatment with pertussis toxin and by inhibition of protein kinase C.
     We propose that activation of both D2L and D4.4 dopamine receptors
     potentiated phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-stimulated ACII activity
     through the release of betagamma subunits from pertussis toxin-sensitive G
     proteins. In contrast, the lack of D3 receptor-mediated effects suggests
     that stimulation of D3 receptors does not result in an appreciable release
     of betagamma subunits.

     Polymorphic gene loci examined included those encoding the dopamine D2
     receptor (NcoI site and Ser-Cys site), the dopamine D3 receptor (BalI
     site), the dopamine D4 receptor (48 bp tandem repeat) and the dopamine
     transporter (40 bp tandem repeat). The genotype distribution at the NcoI
     site in the dopamine D2 receptor gene differed significantly (p < 0.5)
     between alcoholic patients and control subjects. The frequency of 7
     repeats at the 40 bp/DAT tended to be higher (p < 0.1), and that of 9
     repeats tended to be lower (p < 0.1) in alcoholic patients than in control
     subjects. The possible effects of dopamine-related gene polymorphisms,
     which might predispose individuals to alcoholism, are discussed.

     (R)-(+)-2-amino-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-[1-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-oxobutyl]

AB  - (R)-(+)-2-Amino-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-[1-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-oxobutyl]+
     ++pyrrolidin-3-yl]thiazole (NRA0045), a novel thiazole derivative, has
     high affinities for the human cloned dopamine D4.2, D4.4 and D4.7
     receptors, with Ki values of 2.54, 0.55 and 0.54 nM, respectively. NRA0045
     is approximately 91-fold more potent at the dopamine D4.2 receptor,
     compared with human cloned dopamine D2L receptor. NRA0045 also has high
     affinities for the serotonin (5-HT)2A receptor (Ki = 1.92 nM) and alpha-1
     adrenoceptor (Ki = 1.40 nM) but weak affinities (IC50 values are
     approximately 1 microM) for six other neurotransmitter receptors
     (adenosine1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C, dopamine transporter, alpha2A and alpha2A)
     and negligible affinities (IC50 values are over 10(-5) M) for 42 other
     receptors, including neurotransmitters and hormones, ion channels and
     second messenger systems. Locomotor hyperactivity induced by
     methamphetamine (1 mg/kg i.p.) in mice was dose-dependently antagonized by
     NRA0045 (ED50 = 0.5 mg/kg i.p. and 1.9 mg/kg p.o., respectively).
     Methamphetamine (10 mg/kg i.p.)-induced stereotyped behavior in mice was
     dose-dependently antagonized by NRA0045, whereas NRA0045 did not exceed
     50% inhibition even at the highest dose given (30 mg/kg i.p.). Catalepsy
     was dose-dependently and significantly induced by NRA0045 in rats, whereas
     NRA0045 did not exceed 50% induction even at the highest dose given (30
     mg/kg i.p.). Thus NRA0045 blocks behaviors associated with activation of
     the mesolimbic/mesocortical dopaminergic neurons more selectively than
     behaviors associated with nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. In rats,
     tryptamine-induced clonic seizure, a 5-HT2 receptor-mediated behavior, was
     also dose-dependently inhibited by NRA0045 (ED50 = 1.7 mg/kg i.p.).
     Norepinephrine-induced lethality is regarded as being induced through the
     alpha-1 adrenoceptor. NRA0045 dose-dependently antagonized
     norepinephrine-induced lethality in rats (ED50 = 0.2 mg/kg i.p.). Thus
     NRA0045 may have a unique antipsychotic activity with regard to dopamine
     D4 and 5-HT2A receptors and alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonistic activities,
     without producing the extrapyramidal side effects.

TI  - The effects of a selective D4 dopamine receptor antagonist (L-745,870) in
     acutely psychotic inpatients with schizophrenia. D4 Dopamine Antagonist
     Group.
PG  - 567-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Based mainly on the selective antagonism of clozapine at D4
     compared with D2 dopamine receptors, hopes have run high that a selective
     D4 dopamine receptor antagonist might improve the pharmacological
     treatment of patients with schizophrenia. We report, to our knowledge, the
     first multicenter study of the antipsychotic potential of a highly
     specific D4 dopamine receptor antagonist (ie, L-745,870) in patients with
     acute schizophrenia. METHODS: Thirty-eight acutely psychotic and
     neuroleptic responsive (by history) newly admitted inpatients with
     schizophrenia were randomized to 4 weeks of double-blind treatment (2:1)
     with either L-745,870 (n = 26), 15 mg/d, or placebo (n = 12) after a 3- to
     5-day placebo run-in period. RESULTS: Overall, a greater percentage of
     patients receiving L-745,870 compared with patients receiving placebo
     discontinued the study for insufficient therapeutic response (32% vs 16%).
     At the end of 4 weeks by last observation carried forward analysis, the
     mean change from baseline to week 4 on the total Brief Psychiatric Rating
     Scale favored placebo (i.e., -8 points [-15% change from baseline] vs -1
     point [-2% change from baseline] for placebo vs L-745,870, P = .09).
     Similar differences in favor of placebo in changes from baseline mean
     scores were observed for the not carried forward analysis on the total
     Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (P < .03), for not carried forward and last
     observation carried forward analyses on the sum of selected positive
     symptom items of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and for the Clinical
     Global Impression analysis (P = .03, last observation carried forward). A
     greater percentage of patients receiving L-745,870 had scores indicative
     of some level of worsening (compared with baseline) on the total Brief
     Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions' Severity of
     Illness Scale as well as positive symptoms compared with those receiving
     placebo. CONCLUSION: The selective D4 dopamine receptor antagonist
     L-745,870 was ineffective as an antipsychotic for the treatment of
     neuroleptic responsive inpatients with acute schizophrenia.

     receptors genes and alcoholism.
PG  - 281-5
AB  - The human dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) has received considerable
     attention for the past several years as a potential candidate that may
     affect susceptibility to alcoholism. The association studies that compared
     the frequencies of alleles of DRD2 gene between alcoholics and control
     groups have produced equivocal results. Dopamine D3 and D4 receptor genes
     (DRD3 and DRD4) are in the same class as DRD2 but with different
     pharmacological properties. We have used relative risk and haplotype
     relative risk approaches to test associations between alleles of DRD3 and
     DRD4 genes and alcoholism. For relative risk studies 162 probands from
     multiple incidence alcoholic families have been compared to 89
     psychiatrically normal controls. Haplotype relative risk approaches have
     used 29 alcoholic probands in which both parents were available for
     genotyping. The Bal I restriction enzyme site in DRD3 and tandem repeat
     (VNTR) in DRD4 genes polymorphisms were used to genotype the above
     samples. The results of relative risk approaches for both DRD3 and DRD4
     genes were negative for comparisons of alcoholics and subtypes of
     alcoholics with normal controls. Haplotype relative risk approaches also
     were negative for both genes. These results suggest that any role played
     by these receptors may account for only part of the variation in
     susceptibility to alcoholism.

PG  - 251-4
AB  - Only in the past decade has a role of heredity in substance abuse been
     established as a result of extensive twin and family studies. More
     recently, several candidate genes have been investigated for their
     possible role in alcoholism and cocaine abuse. Specific genetic factors in
     opioid substance abuse have not been investigated in man, although animal
     studies suggest that quantitative trait loci (QTLs) can be identified that
     predispose mice both to morphine and alcohol preference. Central
     dopaminergic pathways figure prominently in drug-mediated reinforcement
     suggesting that dopamine receptors are likely candiadates for association
     with substance abuse in man. In addition, we recently reported an
     association between a human personality trait, Novelty Seeking and the
     long alleles (represented chiefly by the 7-repeat) of the D4 dopamine
     receptor (D4DR) exon III polymorphism. The personality trait of Novelty
     Seeking is also more pronounced in substance abusers, who score higher in
     this dimension than control subjects. The twin role of dopamine receptors
     in mediating Novelty Seeking and drugreinforcement prompted us to examine
     a group of Israeli heroin addicts for prevalence of the D4DR repeat
     polymorphism. We now show that the 7-repeat allele is significantly
     over-represented in the opioid-dependent cohort and confers a relative
     risk of 2.46. To our knowledge this is the first report of an association
     between a specific genetic polymorphism and opioid addiction.

TI  - The dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) is not associated with alcoholism in
     three Taiwanese populations: six polymorphisms tested separately and as
     haplotypes.
PG  - 394-405
AB  - The dopaminergic system has been implicated in alcoholism but studies at
     the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2), one of the five dopamine receptors,
     have not given a consistent picture of an association with alcoholism. We
     have now studied the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) using six
     polymorphisms, both separately and as haplotypes. Three groups of
     alcoholics from Taiwan (Atayal, Ami, and Han) diagnosed as having severe
     alcohol dependence using DSM-III-R criteria, together with nonalcoholics
     matched for gender, ethnic group, and geographic origin, were typed by
     polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or PCR-restriction fragment length
     polymorphism (RFLP) for all six polymorphisms. Three out of six markers
     are polymorphic in all three Taiwanese populations. Although the
     prevalence rates of alcoholism are remarkably different, no highly
     significant association of this locus with alcoholism was observed in any
     of the three groups whether the analysis considered genotype distributions
     or allele frequencies at the three polymorphic markers considered
     individually and as haplotypes. Neither is there any obvious pattern in
     the data that covaries with or hints at a relationship with the very
     different prevalences of alcoholism in the groups studied. Especially
     because the powerful, multi-site haplotype analysis was not statistically
     significant in any of the population samples, we conclude that there is no
     association of the DRD4 locus with alcoholism in Taiwanese populations.

AB  - Associations of polymorphic genetic markers at the tyrosine hydroxylase
     (TH) and dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) loci were examined in Scandinavian
     chronic alcoholics (n = 72) and control subjects (n = 67). Patients were
     divided into subgroups with regard to the presence of parental alcoholism
     and age of onset. Neither the TH nor the DRD4 allele distributions were
     significantly different when alcoholic samples were compared with control
     subjects. However, a tendency to high prevalence for 1 of the 5 TH alleles
     assayed (TH-K3) was observed in a subsample of 44 alcoholics characterized
     by late onset when compared with control subjects (27.3% vs. 10.6%, p =
     0.041). Results suggest that no major influence on alcoholism is exerted
     through genes associated with the DRD4 or TH allelic markers examined.

     (NE) play important roles in learning and memory, emotional states, and
     control of voluntary movement, as well as cardiovascular and kidney
     function. They activate distinct but overlapping neuronal pathways through
     five distinct DA receptors (D1R-D5R) and at least 10 different adrenergic
     receptors (alpha 1a/b/c, alpha 2a/b/c-1/c-2, and beta 1/beta 2/beta 3).
     The D4R, which is localized to mesolimbic areas of the brain implicated in
     affective and emotional behavior, has a deduced amino acid sequence with
     homology to both adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor subtypes. We report
     here that DA, EP, and NE all show binding in the nanomolar range to three
     isoforms of the recombinant human D4R (hD4R): D4.2, D4.4, and D4.7.
     Submicromolar concentrations of DA, EP, and NE were sufficient to activate
     hD4R isoforms in two different functional assays: agonist-induced
     guanosine 5'-O-(3-[35S]thiotriphosphate) binding and modulation of
     adenylyl cyclase activity. DA was approximately fivefold more potent than
     EP and NE at the D4R, whereas activation of the human D2R required at
     least 100-fold higher catecholamine concentrations. Functional activation
     of the D4R by multiple neurotransmitters may provide a novel mechanism for
     integration of catecholamine signaling in the brain and periphery.

     receptors.
PG  - 379-83
AB  - The activity of monoamine neurotransmitters was examined at dopamine D4
     receptors. In competition binding with [3H]spiperone, noradrenaline and
     adrenaline exhibited a high affinity binding component (KH = 12.1 nM and
     5.0 nM, respectively), similar to that of dopamine (KH = 2.6 nM), whereas
     serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and histamine had low affinity (Ki >
     1000 nM). Noradrenaline and adrenaline acted as agonists at dopamine D4
     receptors, stimulating receptor-mediated
     [35S]guanylyl-gamma-thiotriphosphate ([35S]GTP gamma S) binding (EC50 =
     7.8 and 5.8 microM, respectively, versus 0.1 microM for dopamine). The
     dopamine D4 receptor-selective ligand,
     3-(4-[4-chlorophenyl]piperazin-1-yl)methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3b]-pyridi ne (L
     745,870) and the dopaminergic antagonists, spiperone, haloperidol and
     clozapine, inhibited noradrenaline-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding
     whereas alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists did not.
     These results indicate that dopamine D4 receptors are activated by
     noradrenaline and adrenaline, although at 50-100-fold higher
     concentrations than dopamine.

AB  - Monoamine metabolite (MM) levels in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are
     extensively used as indirect estimates of monoamine turnover in the brain.
     In this study we investigated genotypes for DNA polymorphisms in the D2
     (DRD2), D3 (DRD3), and D4 (DRD4) dopamine receptor and tyrosine
     hydroxylase (TH) genes and their relationships to CSF MM in healthy
     volunteers (n = 66). Concentrations of homovanillic acid (HVA),
     3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
     (5-HIAA) were corrected for back length, a confounding variable. Corrected
     MM levels were not related to age, gender, height, weight heredity, season
     or atmospheric pressure at sampling. Individuals with specific DRD2 and TH
     allele and genotype configurations significantly differed in HVA and MHPG
     concentrations. DRD3 homo- and heterozygotic genotypes had significantly
     different CSF 5-HIAA levels. DRD4 genotypes were not related to MM
     concentrations. The results suggest that specific DRD2, DRD3, and TH
     genotypes participate in the regulation of monoamine turnover in the
     central nervous system. Accordingly monoamine receptors and synthesizing
     enzyme genotypes appear to be variance factors influencing MM
     concentrations in CSF. The relationships found in this study support MM
     concentrations as markers for monoamine transmission in the human brain.

AB  - Ebstein and colleagues have recently reported a significant association
     between the 7-repeat allele of the dopamine D4 receptor (D4DR) 16 amino
     acid repeat polymorphism and the personality trait of Novelty Seeking (NS)
     in 124 Israeli subjects. This study, and another study conducted in the US
     (although with a different personality measure) that observed a similar
     association, have generated wide interest in the identification of the
     genes involved in personality variation. We have determined D4DR genotypes
     in two groups of Finnish subjects; 193 psychiatrically screened normal
     controls and 138 alcoholic offenders and assessed NS with the
     Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ). In normals, we find no
     significant association between NS and the 7-repeat allele despite similar
     allele frequencies and the use of the same personality measure as Ebstein
     et al. The group of alcoholic offenders have significantly higher NS than
     normals, however we fail to replicate the previous association in this
     group and, in fact, find a significant association in the opposite
     direction as previously observed. These data suggest that D4DR may require
     re-evaluation as a candidate gene for personality variation.

PG  - 113-5
AB  - A point mutation in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2(2) allele) is
     considered to be a genetic deterrent for alcoholism; however, 80 of 655
     Japanese alcoholics had the mutant allele. Genotype factors that might
     increase susceptibility by overriding the deterrent showed a higher
     frequency of a five repeat allele of the dopamine D4 receptor 48 bp repeat
     polymorphism in alcoholics with ALDH2(2) than in 100 other alcoholics and
     144 controls. Alcoholics with the five repeat allele also abused other
     drugs more often. These data suggest the involvement of the dopamine
     system in the development of alcoholism and other addictive behaviour.

TI  - DRD4 dopamine receptor genotype and CSF monoamine metabolites in Finnish
     alcoholics and controls.
PG  - 199-205
AB  - The DRD4 dopamine receptor is thus far unique among neurotransmitter
     receptors in having a highly polymorphic gene structure that has been
     reported to produce altered receptor functioning. These allelic variations
     are caused by a 48-bp segment in exon III of the coding region which may
     be repeated from 2-10 times. Varying the numbers of repeated segments
     changes the length, structure, and, possibly, the functional efficiency of
     the receptor, which makes this gene an intriguing candidate for variations
     in dopamine-related behaviors, such as alcoholism and drug abuse. Thus
     far, these DRD4 alleles have been investigated for association with
     schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, and chronic
     alcoholism, and all have been largely negative for a direct association.
     We evaluated the DRD4 genotype in 226 Finish adult males, 113 of whom were
     alcoholics, many of the early onset type with features of impulsivity and
     antisocial traits. Genotype frequencies were compared to 113 Finnish
     controls who were free of alcohol abuse, substance abuse, and major mental
     illness. In 70 alcoholics and 20 controls, we measured CSF homovanillic
     acid (HVA), the major metabolite of dopamine, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic
     acid (5-HIAA). No association was found between a particular DRD4 dopamine
     receptor allele and alcoholism. CSF concentrations of the monoamine
     metabolites showed no significant difference among the DRD4 genotypes.
     This study of the DRD4 dopamine receptor in alcoholics is the first to be
     conducted in a clinically and ethnically homogeneous population and to
     relate the DRD4 genotype to CSF monoamine concentrations. The results
     indicate that there is no association of the DRD4 receptor with
     alcoholism.

TI  - Receptor mechanisms mediating clozapine-induced c-fos expression in the
     forebrain.
PG  - 747-56
AB  - The atypical antipsychotic clozapine produces distinctly different
     regional patterns of c-fos expression in rat forebrain than does the
     prototypical neuroleptic haloperidol. While haloperidol-induced c-fos
     expression appears to be mediated by its D2 dopamine receptor antagonist
     properties, the mechanisms by which clozapine increases c-fos expression
     remain uncertain. Using a combination of brain lesion, pharmacological and
     immunohistochemical techniques, the present study sought to determine the
     receptor mechanisms by which clozapine increases the number of Fos-like
     immunoreactive neurons in various regions of the forebrain. To test
     whether serotonergic and/or noradrenergic systems are involved in
     clozapine-induced c-fos expression, rats received either
     5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle or
     6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle two weeks
     prior to clozapine (20 mg/kg) injections. Neither type of lesion affected
     clozapine-induced c-fos expression in the rat forebrain, suggesting that
     neither serotonergic nor noradrenergic mechanisms are involved in this
     action of clozapine. In another experiment, the 5-hydroxytryptamine2
     receptor antagonist ritanserin (5 mg/kg), either alone or in combination
     with haloperidol (1 mg/kg), failed to mimic the pattern of c-fos
     expression produced by clozapine. This suggests that clozapine's
     antagonist actions at 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors cannot explain the
     unique pattern of regional c-fos expression produced by this compound. To
     determine whether the blockade of subtypes of the D2 dopamine receptor
     family may contribute to clozapine's effects, the dopamine receptor
     agonists quinpirole and 7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetralin
     (7-OH-DPAT) were injected 15 min prior to clozapine. Quinpirole produced a
     small but significant decrease in clozapine-induced c-fos expression in
     the medial prefrontal cortex, had larger effects in the lateral septum,
     and blocked clozapine's actions in the nucleus accumbens and major island
     of Calleja. Pretreatment with 7-OH-DPAT attenuated clozapine-induced c-fos
     expression in the nucleus accumbens and lateral septum, completely blocked
     the expression in the major island of Calleja, but was without effect in
     the medial prefrontal cortex. Given the different affinities of quinpirole
     and 7-OH-DPAT for D2, D3 and D4 receptors, these data suggest that
     clozapine-induced increases in c-fos expression in the nucleus accumbens,
     major island of Cajella and lateral septal nucleus are due to antagonist
     actions of this antipsychotic at D3 dopamine receptors. They also indicate
     that while antagonist actions at D4 receptors may contribute, the primary
     mechanisms by which clozapine increases c-fos expression in the medial
     prefrontal cortex remain to be determined.

PG  - 174-81
AB  - Individual alleles identified by candidate gene analysis have been shown
     to profoundly influence certain complex behavioral syndromes including
     vulnerability to alcoholism. The alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase
     polymorphisms, ADH2(2) and ALDH2(2), respectively, are associated with
     lower vulnerability to alcoholism both in the Orient and also in North
     America among populations of Taiwanese and Koreans who have immigrated
     there. Protein structural variants have recently been identified for a
     series of genes involved in dopamine and serotonin function. Three
     dopamine receptors exhibit such structural variants, and these include the
     DRD2 dopamine receptor, which has three relatively rare amino acid
     substitutions. Structural polymorphisms were detected in five serotonin
     receptors (5HT1A, 5HT1Db, 5HT2A, 5HT2C, and 5HT7). Association studies
     between neurotransmitter gene variants and alcoholism are at an earlier
     stage than with ADH2(2)/ALDH2(2), but results are thus far negative
     (dopamine DRD4 receptor), equivocal (dopamine DRD2 receptor), or
     preliminary (tryptophan hydroxylase, 5HT2C and 5HT1Db).

TI  - Pharmacological and functional characterization of D2, D3 and D4 dopamine
     receptors in fibroblast and dopaminergic cell lines.
PG  - 495-502
AB  - In order to study the properties of the D2-like dopamine receptors, D2, D3
     and D4 clones were transfected into mouse Ltk- fibroblasts, CCL1.3, and a
     neuronal mesencephalic cell line, MN9D. Most of the derived antagonist and
     agonist inhibition constants were the same for a given receptor in either
     cell line as determined by saturation and competition binding experiments.
     The rank order potencies for antagonists are: eticlopride, D2 > D3 > D4;
     YM-09151-2, D2 = D4 > D3; spiperone, D2 = D3 > D4; (+)-butaclamol, D2 > D3
     > D4; clozapine, D4 > D2 > D3; and for agonists, quinpirole, D3 = D4 > D2;
     7-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl)-aminotetralin, D3 > D2 = D4. Functionally, D2
     stimulation increases inositol phosphate levels in CCL1.3 cells but not in
     MN9D, whereas D2 activation inhibits forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP
     levels in both cell lines. D4 stimulation has no effect on inositol
     phosphate metabolism in either cell type, but inhibits adenylate cyclase
     in MN9D cells. Both the D2 and D4 mediated decreases in cyclic AMP can be
     blocked by preincubation with pertussis toxin. D3 does not couple to these
     pathways in either cell line. Reverse transcription/polymerase chain
     reaction techniques were used to determine the availability of cellular
     signalling systems. Both CCL1.3 and MN9D cells have high levels of G alpha
     i2 expression, whereas neither cell expresses G alpha i1 or G alpha i3.
     These data imply that the D2 receptor couples to the G alpha i2 subtype in
     both cell lines, whereas D4 does not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - The role of dopamine in the regulation of melatonin biosynthesis in
     vertebrate retina.
PG  - 47-56
AB  - The vertebrate retina rhythmically synthesizes melatonin, a hormone
     involved in the regulation of several intraocular processes cued by
     environmental lighting conditions. The rhythm of retinal melatonin
     production, with maximal synthesis at night in darkness, is driven by the
     photoperiodic environment to which animals are exposed, and is generated
     by an endogenous circadian clock(s). This article reviews data on the role
     of dopamine, an established retinal neurotransmitter and paracrine factor,
     as a mediator of acute suppressive and entrainment action of light on the
     melatonin generating system in the retina. Special emphasis is given to
     the characterization of dopamine receptor types involved in the control of
     retinal melatonin formation.
